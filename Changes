*   comment out SVG mention in Builder.pm, Page.pm & POD until finished

    t/text.t  per PDF::API2 add two tests for charspace and wordspace override

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Dict-File.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm, examples/041_annot_fileattach,
      examples/060_transparency, examples/resources/sample_55.pdf, 
      examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     Output 'endobj' starting its own line. Some PDF validators raise a
      stink if endobj continues a line with other commands on it. 
      While we're at it, put 'stream' starting its own line, too.
      Fix two examples that failed to validate. There is a third failure, but
      it appears to be an issue with PDF/A disallowed content (embedded files),
      not a bug in PDF production here.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, 
      examples/025_unifonts, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm
     Fix uninitialized value (missingwidth), remove -slant (deprecated).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF.pm
     Corrected some bilevel color inverts.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File_GT.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm
     Some improvements to deal with inverted colors (black/white) on certain
      TIFF images. Now G3 and G4 (CCITT Fax) get flipped to the correct
      colors, as does uncompressed bilevel. There are still some TIFF cases 
      which are not fully properly dealt with; we are still working on them.
     
    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, examples/040_annotation, 
      examples/041_annot_fileattach
     Add "-opacity" option to control the opacity (opaqueness) of the icon,
      where the default of 1.0 is fully opaque, and 0.0 is fully transparent.
      Add "markup" method to implement "highlighted" text annotations, per
      [GitHub #142]. These include "Highlight" (in the manner of a highlighter
      marker), "Squiggly" (squiggly underline), "Underline", and "StrikeOut".
      These behave like a "text" annotation, but instead of an icon, the
      document text is highlighted.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  improve -strikethru placement

    INFO/LICENSE, README.md, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Array-Bool-Dict-
      File-Filter-Name-Null-Number-Objind-Page-Pages-String-Utils.pm
     Update file headers on code originally written by Martin Hosken to
      reflect that he has granted permission to use the MIT license instead
      of the Perl Artistic License on his code. This change was made so
      that Red Hat could have licensing compatible with LGPL for releasing
      PDF::Builder as part of Fedora.
