    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, MANIFEST, README.md, tools/3_examples.pl, 
      examples/Column.pl, examples/Column_lists.pl (new), devtools/PDFbuild.pl
     Rearchitect list (ul and ol) generation to improve appearance and permit
      upgrades to capabilities. Add <marker> tag to permit overrides of 
      properties of individual <ol> and <ul> markers (e.g., bullet color) at 
      any or all <li>. This non-standard HTML tag can be used explicitly to 
      modify marker properties, and is automatically inserted into the code if 
      not manually given. The new (non-standard) CSS properties are
        _marker-text (define text to use as marker, rather than default)
        _marker-color (change color from default) 
        _marker-font (change marker font-family)
        _marker-style (change marker font-style, e.g., italic)
        _marker-size (change marker font-size)
        _marker-weight (change marker font-weight)
      The defaults are the normal font-family, color, etc. inherited from
      the <ol> or <ul> tag, updated by the usual suspects (style, CSS, etc.),
      and finally overridden by _marker-* properties (inherited and set in the
      usual manner). If you nest lists, you may need to cancel _marker-* 
      properties by setting them to ''. Note that if you set something like the
      "color" property in the <ol> or <ul> tag, it will *also* apply to each
      <li> list item! Instead, set "_marker-color" to affect only markers.
      Split out list examples from Column.pl examples, into Column_lists.pl.
*     CSS text-align property for left, center, and right added. Not fully imp.
* _marker-* properties not fully tested yet
* superfluous marker(s) when splitting a <li> across columns. did <marker>
  get deleted once ink hit paper, as it should have?
* remember to update Docs.pm, #195 (after release!) see UPDATE_195.txt

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, examples/Column.pl
     Fold all HTML tags to lower case (to support <P> etc.), detect 
      unsupported or invalid tags and give error message (just once for each, 
      per column() call). Treat unknown tags as <span> tag. In Column.pl,
*     change a few tags to upper case, add some bogus tags (expect error msg)?

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm
     Fix #210 (reported in API2 #75) default_page_size() was failing.

    lib/PDF/Builder/docs/buildDoc.pl
     Add run suggestions and examples for other structures of packages.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/CoreFont.pm
     Expand on descriptions of standard and Windows core fonts.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, README.md, examples/Column.pl
     There is an apparent bug in HTML::TreeBuilder (HTML::Tree #8), where <ins> 
      and <del> tags cause unwanted paragraph breaks. The best solution, until
      the TreeBuilder prereq HTML::Tagset is fixed, is to edit HTML::Tagset
      and make a one line fix. HTML::Tagset 3.21 and later may already be
      updated.
      
      In \Strawberry\perl\vendor\lib\HTML\Tagset.pm (location of Tagset.pm
      will vary on other Perls and OS's):
        1. Find  %isPhraseMarkup = map {; $_ => 1 } qw(
        2. Below that find     b i u s tt small big
        3. Add a new line below that:   ins del
      This adds <ins> and <del> to the list of inline tags.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, docs/buildDoc.pl, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/UniFont.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/CJKFont-TrueType.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resoure/Font/BdFont-CoreFont-Postscript-SynFont.pm,
     Rearrange some of the documentation and update some "Options" lists to
      make looking up font options more straightforward and complete.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
      Move end/endpath description (POD) to a more appropriate section.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
      If open() for update, check that existing PDF is read/write. Also report
       any error opening a PDF, and die, instead of just returning.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs-Outlines-Outline.pm
      Clarify and extend the documentation for creating and maintaining
       outlines (bookmarks), including how to create multilevel (nested)
       bookmarks. Remove '$prev' entry from Outline's constructor, as it
       appears to have never functioned as intended. Instead, use the methods
       insert_before() and insert_after() to place a bookmark within an
       existing list. If you *are* successfully using '$prev', please describe
       how you are using it so I can document it and restore it to the code!
*  note that original Outline problem remains to be fixed

    README.md, contrib/*, examples/*, tools/*, devtools/PDFbuild.pl, 
      devtools/PDFversion.pl, docs/buildDoc.pl
     Bite the bullet and change "my $LAST_UPDATE" to "our $LAST_UPDATE", and
      remove the build-time edit of all these files. .pm file instances were
      already changed earlier during POD structure updates.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNG_IPL.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File_GT.pm
     Update Image::PNG::Libpng handling so that SVGPDF library will be able
      to handle inlined PNG images by passing an IO::String "filehandle" from
      File::LoadLines, etc. Also, TIFF (with Graphics::TIFF usage) will now
      accept filehandles (at least, "GLOB" type) as input, and write out a
      temporary file to use. Certain operating systems seem to have trouble
      erasing the temporary file, so temps may build up over time! This area of
      filehandle inputs is still being actively investigated. It appears that
      all image formats except GD (GIF, JPEG, TIFF, TIFF with Graphics::TIFF, 
      PNM, PNG, and PNG with Image::PNG::Libpng) can now be given either a 
      filepath and name, or a Perl filehandle.

    examples/RMtutorial.pl
     Correct font 'Times' to 'Times-Roman' to avoid warning messages.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     Correct placement of content of "object" and in POD elaborate on necessary
      corrections that may be needed.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Recommend workaround for problems with Adobe Acrobat Reader when 
      displaying decimal (only) page labels (need to specify "start").

    (most .pm files) update POD for more consistent appearance, including links
      for major entries and methods.
    docs/buildDoc.pl put NAVIGATION links at the top of the Table of Contents,
      since usually now many more entries are in the TOC. The links themselves
      are still at the bottom of the page.
    devtools/PDFbuild.pl updates found to be needed in 3.026 build.
    devtools/html2php.pl updates found to be needed.
    MANIFEST add INFO/Changes_2023.

(see INFO/Changes_2023 for earlier changes)

Note that INFO/Changes-ver_2 (for changes released for PDF::API2, and 
incorporated into PDF::Builder) is NOT being updated any longer. You may
assume that any change logged for API2 has also been incorporated into
Builder, with any exceptions or differences noted here.
