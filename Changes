3.024     2022-07-16  UNRELEASED

*   see what's going on with ->transform(translate=>[ ]) vs ->translate()
    possibly something new in API2 update. translate vs old -translate

*   t/tiff.t  IF GhostScript problem unresolved by release date, go ahead and 
      restrict Ghostscript 9.56.* in tests. This is a SEPARATE problem from 
      GD's failure to build in CI (fix in but unreleased). ***************

*   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Per RT 136648, PDF::API2 fix to avoid unnecessary extra trailers 
      (reported by Chris Papademetrious, fix by Vadim Repin from RT117184).
     compare code after other changes in

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm
     "loca" table in TTF is optional, so to fix PDFAPI2#47, return from 
     subsetByCId() method early if no such table. According to PDFAPI2#37, it
     may be necessary to instruct ttfont() to NOT subset the font. Also, it
     appears that 'glyf' table may be missing in some fonts, so add check.
*  check pdfapi2-47.pl once "position" implemented, to see if completely fixed
   appears to be problem with incomplete embedded font (reported by Reader)
   in PDFAPI2. pdfapi2-37 may be related.

**  confirm build process is clean, especially all the new uses of version, 
    plus new Perl 5.24 minimum

*   t/info.t (new), t/version.t (new), MANIFEST, tools/2_t-tests.pl

*   lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/ViewerPreferences.pm (new), MANIFEST
     Per PDF::API2 change, split up function of $pdf->preferences into several
      easier-to-use methods: page_mode(), page_layout(), viewer_preferences(),
      open_action().

    lib/PDF/Builder/NamedDestination-Annotation.pm, t/named-destinations.t, 
      MANIFEST, tools/2_t-tests.pl
     Minor cleanup plus locations may now be given without leading dashes.
      'link' is now alias for 'goto', 'file' is now alias for 'launch', 'url' 
      is now alias for 'uri', and 'pdf_file' and 'pdfile' are now aliases for 
      'pdf' method names.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Dict.pm
     Fix doubled $class (per PDF::API2 fix).

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/font-ttf.t, font-type1.t
     Add convenience font() method to combine corefont(), ttfont(), psfont(),
      and bdfont(). This is for PDF::API2 compatibility, and the original
      methods are unchanged. Font search path changes: add font_path() and
      set_font_path() for base search paths for fonts. Rename addFontDirs()
      to add_to_font_path() (keeping the old name around).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm, lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Deprecate unneeded update() method. Per PDF::API2 changes.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, t/deprecations.t, t/pdf.t, t/rt67767.t
     Rename method open_scalar() to from_string(). from_string() should be
      used for new work. This is for compatibility with PDF::API2 changes
      renaming open_scalar() to from_string(). Although open_scalar() should 
      still be supported for some time, it is possible that it may be 
      deprecated and removed in the future.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Permit the save(filename) method to be used as an alias for 
      saveas(filename). This is for compatibility with PDF::API2 changes 
      combining save() and saveas().

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Lite.pm, t/annotate.t, t/barcode.t,
      t/bbox.t, t/circular-references.t, t/content.t, t/cs-webcolor.t, 
      t/deprecations.t, t/extgstate.t, t/gd.t, t/gif.t, t/jpg.t, t/outlines.t,

      t/text.t, t/tiff.t, t/viewer-preferences.t, examples/011_open_update,
      t/resources/test-rgba.png (new), MANIFEST
     pdf->stringify() renamed to pdf->to_string() (original still available).
      Also catch up on some new t-tests from API2.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File-Objind.pm  
     Per RT131657 PDF::API2 fix, Suppress recursion warnings while releasing 
      (destroying) PDF indirect objects, which can be highly-interconnected 
      (reported by Leon Winter).

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Revise RT41971 fix per PDF::API2 change for outlines (no functional change)

    lib/PDF/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm   code cleanup per PDF::API2

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  per PDF::API2 fix, messages if fail to open input PDF

    CONTRIBUTING  minor update

    docs/buildDoc.pl  update to better handle non-PDF::Builder doc builds

    Makefile.PL, META.json, META.yml, README.md
     Perl 5.24 is the earliest supported version.

    README.md add manual build section

    t/tiff.t add exclude_version() function to exclude GhostScript or
      ImageMagick from all or selected uses, if your installed version
      falls with a range of excluded version numbers.

    META.json, META.yml, MANIFEST add "provides" entry to make package
      sites happier.

    INFO/RoadMap add comments on PCF-format bitmapped fonts, and possible
      MathJax-based eqn support.

    INFO/LICENSE, MANIFEST 
      License moved up to top level, to make package sites happier.

    examples/HarfBuzz.pl, examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     Add 'fj' and 'ij' ligatures, although Times doesn't appear to include 
     them.

    examples/020_textrise add baselines and additional examples

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, examples/HarfBuzz.pl
     Adobe Acrobat DC has changed its installed fonts location, so several
      non-Latin entries had to be updated.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm
     Per PDF::API2 code style changes and uninitialized variable fix.

    INFO/Changes_2021, MANIFEST, README.md, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, INFO/LICENSE
     2022 copyright.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, t/annotate.t, examples/040_annotation, 
      examples/041_annot_fileattach, examples/042_links
     Annotations revert to "no border" [#176] to match up with PDF::API2 
      behavior.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  per #171, allow blank or prefix-only page label (on 
     Reader's thumb slider) with -style => 'nocounter'.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Per RT 136648, PDF::API2 fix when writing xref streams. Note that while
      there is no longer an error message (fixed some time ago in PDF::Builder),
      there is still some new material (an XRef stream) added at the end of 
      the PDF, at each save (for both PDF::API2 and PDF::Builder). Something
      still needs to be done about this, some time later.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/GD-GIF-JPEG-PNG-PNM-TIFF.pm
     Add -name option to name the image object if desired.
      In sync with PDF::API2, add -compress option for PNM. 

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/GIF-PNM.pm minor changes to sync
      with PDF::API2 changes.

    examples/HarfBuzz.pl, examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     show a better Chinese (CJK) example in vertical mode, which demonstrates 
      rotation of punctuation such as ( ). Continuation of #144.

    INFO/RoadMap  comments on page labeling (slider thumb) enhancements per 
      #171, including possibly integrating with header() and footer() calls
      that place a page number on the paper, and any outline/bookmarks, so
      that they all give a consistent page label (number).

    optional_update.pl, MANIFEST, README.md 
     optional_update moved to tools/, otherwise it
      was being placed in the PDF/ directory by the installer. Note that you 
      should be in your PDF::Builder root (parent of tools/) and run
      tools/optional_update.pl.
