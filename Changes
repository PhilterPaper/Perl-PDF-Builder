3.013     2018-11-05 (unreleased)

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm enable dash pattern in -border option.
    lib/PDF/Builder/NamedDestination.pm remove -border and -rect options
      from POD, as there seems to be no code to implement them. A link (with
      -rect and -border) to a Named Destination should be taken care of in the
      Annotation module.

3.012     2018-10-26

   new PNG_IPL module got caught by t/00-all-usable.t on test systems that did 
     not have Image::PNG::Libpng installed. Exclude from test, and add 
     reminder in Makefile.PL to update 00-all-usable.t.

3.011     2018-10-25

   move .travis.yml.HOLD and dist.ini.old from the root to INFO/, to unclutter
     the root. It is unknown when and if they will ever be used.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm  [ref RT 125917] minor fix to properly 
     implement a default target page fit (-xyz), otherwise the link() 
     method would not go to the desired target page. Some minor POD updates
     to indicate that some functionality depends on the PDF reader (e.g.,
     mouseover text on a link).
   lib/PDF/Builder/XObject/Resource/Image/PNG.pm-PNG_IPL.pm
     minor POD updates

   lib/PDF/Builder/XObject/Resource/Image/PNG-PNG_IPL-TIFF-TIFF_GT.pm,
     Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm,
     t/png.t
    [ref RT 124349] If libpng.a and its wrapper, Image::PNG::Libpng are 
     installed, use them to process PNG files for inclusion into a PDF 
     document. If this library is not installed, or the user directs that 
     it is not be used via the -nouseIPL option, the existing pure Perl 
     PNG library (PNG.pm) will be used. The new library (PNG_IPL.pm) is 
     considerably faster than the old one and offers support for 16 bits 
     per sample and interlaced images*. Documentation has been updated in 
     TIFF and TIFF_GT, and functions LA_GT() and LA_IPL() have been added 
     to Builder to check LibraryAvailability (package availability) for 
     Graphics::TIFF and Image::PNG::Libpng, so you can know in advance 
     whether it is safe to try to use certain image functionality.

     * interlacing is removed during processing, so it is irrelevant to
       PDF, and 16bps channels (force PDF 1.5) can be reduced to 8bps, 
       permitting PDF 1.4 output, by use of the -force8bps option.

   Makefile.PL  try directing support issues to GitHub rather than CPAN RT

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm while working on 124349, I noticed that a partially 
    transparent RGBA PNG file (white background made transparent) with -notrans 
    option was showing as transparent. The problem was found to be that no
    options given in the image_png() call, such as -notrans, were being passed 
    to the PNG image processing routine. This has been fixed.

   docs/buildDoc.pl modified to first look for .pod files, and then .pm files
    for producing documentation .html files. It still has some issues with
    finding too much input, but is generally workable. The POD search path
    needs further work, as references to other packages often don't work 
    (don't produce a working link, but a severe error message).

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm  internal routine proc_pages() renamed _proc_pages(),
    walk_obj() renamed _walk_obj(), and add POD for save() method. There is a 
    release() method that is undocumented but it's not clear whether it's 
    internal. Improve documentation of mediabox and other *box methods.
   lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm-Matrix.pm-Outline.pm-Page.pm minor POD fixes.
    There are a lot of low level calls (e.g., Array.pm) that perhaps should not
    be considered as part of the User API (i.e., remove from POD).

   lib/PDF/Builder/Outline.pm-NamedDestination.pm-Annotation.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED
    deprecate pdfile() method and replace by pdf_file() (same as done earlier
     for Annotation.pm). pdfile() will be removed on or after October, 2020.
   lib/PDF/Builder/XObject/Resource/Image/TIFF_GT.pm-TIFF.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED
    remove warning and support for Blackls1 (should be BlackIs1).

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/Content.pl
    [ref RT 124218] add -strikethru text capability similar to -underline.
     New example of strike-through in Content.pl examples.

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm  [ref #93] Bringing PDF::Builder into the 21st century
    add -outver option (default: 1.4) to new() as output PDF version. It will
     be increased by any PDF file read in with a higher PDF level (with message)
     or by a call to version().
    add -msgver option (default: 1) to output (value 1) a warning message when
     the PDF output version is increased by verCheckInput() or verCheckOutput().
     A value of 0 suppresses the warning messages.
    add verCheckInput(version) to give warning if PDF just read in is of higher 
     PDF version than the current version, and to increase the current version 
     to that level. Implemented for reading of PDF files. 
    WARNING: just because the PDF output version has been increased does NOT 
     guarantee that any particular content will be handled correctly! There 
     are many known cases of PDF 1.5 and up files being read in, that have 
     content that PDF::Builder does not handle correctly, corrupting the 
     resulting PDF. Pay attention to run-time warning messages that the PDF 
     output level has been increased due to a PDF file being read in, and check 
     the resulting file carefully.
    add verCheckOutput(version, description) to increase the output PDF version 
     if a PDF feature that requires a higher PDF version is requested. At this
     time, there are no output features higher than 1.4.
    in version(), give warning if LOWERING the output PDF version (not 
     suppressed by -msgver).
   lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm-Name.pm
    internally store PDF version as full number (e.g., 1.4) instead of just the
     minor version (e.g., 4), as PDF 2.0 has been announced.
   t/02-xrefstm.t, t/03-xrefstm-index.t
    both t-tests read in a PDF-1.5 file, so add a call to new(-outver=>1.5) to
     silence the warning message that the maximum version is being increased.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Basefont.pm-CIDFont.pm-UniFont.pm
    fix typo variable name $ident to $indent (indentation)
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/UniFont.pm
    [ref RT 126274/#96] (reporter: fcc_del) by adding missing indentation
     value to recursive text() call (rather than reporter's more complex fix).

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
    [ref RT 98539] (need to verify flatness function) close. According to PDF 
     spec, there's no real way to tell by eye whether it's within tolerance, and
     results are unpredictable if you try to force visible line segments with
     a higher tolerance. Also update POD to clarify the range of permissible
     tolerance values, and silently clamp the input value to be in that range.

     README, SUPPORT
    move to new INFO/ directory, as things were starting to get a little
     crowded in the root directory. Changes and MANIFEST are used by the 
     system and can not be moved. MANIFEST updated to reflect new structure.

   Changes, Changes_2017, MANIFEST
     split up Change logs by year, to make them easier to handle.

   docs/, docs/buildDoc.pl, MANIFEST
     provide a tool and place to build the HTML pages from PODs in the
     PDF::Builder module sources. The .html files are NOT shipped with either
     the Perl build or on GitHub. 

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNG.pm
     [ref RT 124349] code cleanup while looking at issue of why PNG RGBA
     processing is so incredibly slow. Suspect that the heavy use of the
     Perl vec() call may have something to do with it. To be continued...

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/Content.pl, examples/Bspline.pl, 
     t/content.t, MANIFEST, examples.bat
    [ref CTS 8] add "bspline" method to draw a smoothly continuous curve 
     (using blended cubic Bezier curves) through all the given points. In 
     addition, the first and/or last points may be specified as visible or 
     invisible straight line or curved segments in order to constrain the 
     spline's behavior at the endpoints.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/Content.pl, t/content.t, DEPRECATED
     [ref CTS 8] change "spline" method name to "qbspline", and deprecate 
     "spline". This is to reflect that this method is actually a piecewise 
     (non-continuous) series of quadratic Bezier curves, and not a true spline. 

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, MANIFEST 
     Add POD commentary on input and output PDF version supported.
     Move POD function details out of Builder.pm to a lower level "Docs" 
       routine, in order to reduce the POD clutter.

   .perl-version, dist.ini.old, .travis.yml.HOLD, Makefile.PL, 
     lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/UniWrap.pm, MANIFEST
    change minimum Perl release level from 5.8.6 to Perl 5.16.0, per PDF::API2. 
     The intent is to "support major Perl versions released in the past six 
     years, plus one major release before that one. This should provide 
     backward compatibility for the life of most LTS server distributions, 
     while eliminating the need to troubleshoot warnings and bugs that only 
     show up in increasingly-ancient versions of Perl." For this release, it 
     means that the minimum supported Perl is 5.16 (first released 2012-05-20...
     see https://www.cpan.org/src/ "First release in each branch of Perl" for 
     dates, NOT "Latest releases in each branch of Perl"!). The next version 
     bump (to 5.18) should be after 2019-05-18.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm
     use confess (Carp.pm) rather than die, per PDF::API2.

   examples/*, examples.bat
     moved output PDFs for several examples from the current directory to the 
     examples directory, in the same style as the rest of the example outputs. 
     Note that contrib.bat still outputs in the current directory.

    minor code styling changes to make perlcritic (level 4) happy, including 
     adding explicit "return" on all routines where missing, and not using 
     variables $a and $b ("magic" according to perlcritic). Some changes 
     suggested by PDF::API2 for this. There are many other level 4 errors yet 
     to be gotten rid of: "Code before warnings" and "Warnings disabled at" due 
     to use of "no warnings", "Close filehandles as soon as possible" due to 
     too many lines between "open" and "close" calls, "Always unpack @_ first" 
     (perlcritic doesn't like much about using the @_ array), "Subroutine name 
     is a homonym for a builtin function" (e.g., our own "open" in contrast to 
     CORE::open), "Symbols are exported by default" (doesn't like @EXPORT_OK 
     usage). Most other perlcritic level 4 complaints were permanently fixed, 
     but a few, such as "grep" and "map" formats, have been suppressed with 
     "no critic" statements. Those might be revisited later.

   pc.bat
     add batch file to run perlcritic

   lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm
     a few minor code styling changes, per PDF::API2. Most of the PDF::API2 
     changes were already in PDF::Builder, and some I declined because the 
     style was not consistent.

   examples.bat, examples/024_bdffonts, examples/examples.output
     some minor improvements to bitmapped (BDF) display output. Bitmap font
     support is still _very_ buggy! Does anyone actually _use_ bitmapped fonts?

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm 
     stringify() make sure return value has at least empty string for content. 
     Several cases of -unicodemap check for true, not 1. After PDF::API2 
     changes for perlcritic.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     outobjdeep() check -docompress is true, not 1. bogen() explicitly default 
     move, larger, reverse to "false" (0). isvirtual(), ' apiistext' check for 
     true, not 1. After PDF::API2 changes for perlcritic.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     add support for cross-reference streams (PDF 1.5) using 64-bit field 
     widths, per PDF::API2 changes.

   .travis.yml.HOLD, MANIFEST
     name restore (from .tgravis.yml). May attempt at some point to make use of 
     Travis for testing. Currently my system seems to not be supportive of
     Travis modules, and I don't have a Travis account. I vaguely recall the
     CPAN system trying to use .travis.yml in my first release, and requiring 
     an immediate release update, so I'm not using the name .travis.yml for now.
