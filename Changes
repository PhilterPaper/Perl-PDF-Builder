    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  Add example of using add() function to
      cancel Chrome browser scaling and Y-axis flip before new content is
      added to an existing PDF.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm
      Remind users not to use charspace() when working with a connected (script)
      font such as Arabic, Devanagari, cursive handwriting, etc. Add -nocs
      option to text line fill (justified) routines to not use any charspace()
      values when expanding or shrinking text content to fit.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm. The earlier fix for corrupted xref table
      only ran under diagnostics. Now only the warning message is under the
      diagnostics flag (-diags), and the fixup attempt is always run.
