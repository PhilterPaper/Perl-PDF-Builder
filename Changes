* issue: why do *.pl show up as siblings to Builder.pm? something in
         PDFbuild.pl routine when it updates .pl file VERSIONs?

    CONTRIBUTING, MANIFEST
      Add file (at CPAN's request) suggesting how best to contribute to 
      the project.

    examples/025_unifonts, 3_examples.pl, INFO/old/examples.bat
      The data used by 025_unifonts (attached PDF-J document) is encoded in 
      SJIS. This is invalid UTF-8 and caused the script to blow up. The fix is
      to inform Perl that the DATA being read is SJIS, so it can be encoded on
      the fly to UTF-8.
