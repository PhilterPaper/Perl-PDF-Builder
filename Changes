3.024     2022-07-07  UNRELEASED

*   see what's going on with ->transform(translate=>[ ]) vs ->translate()
    possibly something new in API2 update. translate vs old -translate

*   t/tiff.t  IF GhostScript problem unresolved by release date, go ahead and 
      restrict Ghostscript 9.56.* in tests. This is a SEPARATE problem from 
      GD's failure to build in CI (fix in but unreleased). ***************

*   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Per RT 136648, PDF::API2 fix to avoid unnecessary extra trailers 
      (reported by Chris Papademetrious, fix by Vadim Repin from RT117184).
     compare code after other changes in

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm
     "loca" table in TTF is optional, so to fix PDFAPI2#47, return from 
     subsetByCId() method early if no such table. According to PDFAPI2#37, it
     may be necessary to instruct ttfont() to NOT subset the font. Also, it
     appears that 'glyf' table may be missing in some fonts, so add check.
*  check pdfapi2-47.pl once "position" implemented, to see if completely fixed
   appears to be problem with incomplete embedded font (reported by Reader)
   in PDFAPI2. pdfapi2-37 may be related.

**  confirm build process is clean, especially all the new uses of version, 
    plus new Perl 5.24 minimum

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File-Objind.pm  
     Per RT131657 PDF::API2 fix, Suppress recursion warnings while releasing

      (reported by Leon Winter).

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm
     Revise RT41971 fix per PDF::API2 change for outlines (no functional change)

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  per PDF::API2 fix, messages if fail to open input PDF

    CONTRIBUTING  minor update

    docs/buildDoc.pl  update to better handle non-PDF::Builder doc builds

    Makefile.PL, META.json, META.yml, README.md
     Perl 5.24 is the earliest supported version.

    README.md add manual build section

    t/tiff.t add exclude_version() function to exclude GhostScript or
      ImageMagick from all or selected uses, if your installed version
      falls with a range of excluded version numbers.

    META.json, META.yml, MANIFEST add "provides" entry to make package
      sites happier.

    INFO/RoadMap add comments on PCF-format bitmapped fonts, and possible
      MathJax-based eqn support.

      License moved up to top level, to make package sites happier.

    examples/HarfBuzz.pl, examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     Add 'fj' and 'ij' ligatures, although Times doesn't appear to include 
     them.

    examples/020_textrise add baselines and additional examples

    lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, examples/HarfBuzz.pl
     Adobe Acrobat DC has changed its installed fonts location, so several
      non-Latin entries had to be updated.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont.pm
     Per PDF::API2 code style changes and uninitialized variable fix.

    INFO/Changes_2021, MANIFEST, README.md, lib/PDF/Builder.pm, INFO/LICENSE
     2022 copyright.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, t/annotate.t, examples/040_annotation, 
      examples/041_annot_fileattach, examples/042_links
     Annotations revert to "no border" [#176] to match up with PDF::API2 
      behavior.

    lib/PDF/Builder.pm  per #171, allow blank or prefix-only page label (on 
     Reader's thumb slider) with -style => 'nocounter'.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     Per RT 136648, PDF::API2 fix when writing xref streams. Note that while
      there is no longer an error message (fixed some time ago in PDF::Builder),
      there is still some new material (an XRef stream) added at the end of 
      the PDF, at each save (for both PDF::API2 and PDF::Builder). Something
      still needs to be done about this, some time later.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/GD-GIF-JPEG-PNG-PNM-TIFF.pm
     Add -name option to name the image object if desired.
      In sync with PDF::API2, add -compress option for PNM.

      with PDF::API2 changes.

    examples/HarfBuzz.pl, examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     show a better Chinese (CJK) example in vertical mode, which demonstrates 
      rotation of punctuation such as ( ). Continuation of #144.

    INFO/RoadMap  comments on page labeling (slider thumb) enhancements per 
      #171, including possibly integrating with header() and footer() calls
      that place a page number on the paper, and any outline/bookmarks, so
      that they all give a consistent page label (number).

    optional_update.pl, MANIFEST, README.md 
     optional_update moved to tools/, otherwise it
      was being placed in the PDF/ directory by the installer. Note that you 
      should be in your PDF::Builder root (parent of tools/) and run
      tools/optional_update.pl.
