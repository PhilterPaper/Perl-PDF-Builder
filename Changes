3.023     2021-04-17  UNRELEASED

*   [ ] t/deprecations.t, INFO/DEPRECATED 
     Update to test all deprecated interfaces and replacements
*   [ ] check all examples and internal calls for deprecated interfaces

*   [ ] latest round of PDF::API2 changes

    lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Filter/LZWDecode.pm, lib/PDF/Builder.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF-TIFF_GT.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File-File_GT.pm, 
      t/filter-lzwdecode.t, t/tiff.t, t/00-all-usable.t, Makefile.PL
     Further improvements to TIFF LZW file handling [ref GH 151 and PR 156] for 
      single and multi-strip, and horizontal predictor. Continuation of work
      to stop converting LZW-compressed TIFF to Flate. Code by @carygravel.
      Increase required Graphics::TIFF version to 10 due to fix in GT.

    examples/README, examples/examples.output
     Discuss the issue of close heavy lines in the example bar codes appearing 
      to merge or "blot" together. This is at least partially a consequence of 
      lower resolution display screens (rounding errors), and although the bars 
      separate when printed, I'm still concerned that they will not be reliably 
      scannable.  

    All files (.pm and .pl) containing $LAST_UPDATE can now access this
      string from outside the file, in the same manner as $VERSION. The
      variable declarator has been changed from 'my' to 'our'.

    INFO/Changes-ver_2, /lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/String.pm, t/string.t
     Per PDF::API2 changes related to [RT 134957], change some regex flags 
      to fix encoding of \n in a PDF string.

    t/tiff.t add version check (not just if installed) for ImageMagick and
      Ghostscript. Some smoke tests apparently blew up for using too low
      level versions. If too low version, or any problems determining the
      version, tiff.t fails gracefully by skipping those tests.

    t/tiff.t use a temporary directory for various test files, enabling use
      from a Read-Only directory and/or running tests in parallel (#153).

3.022     2021-03-27

    docs/buildDoc.pl add "end of page" (###) marker to make it clear that
      you're seeing the bottom of the HTML page.

    Update build process to ensure consistent "unix" formatting of most 
      human-readable files (#150). Some non-CPAN builds were complaining
      about MS-DOS format (CRLF line ends) on some files.

    t/tiff.t, lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF-TIFF_GT.pm
     Per #148, update by carygravel to stop converting LZW-compressed TIFFs
      to Flate compression (unnecessary, as PDF directly supports LZW, and 
      there were supposedly some edge-case bugs in the code).
      == REMOVED == still problems, development under way

    t/tiff.t per #143, update by carygravel to enable proper TIFF testing 
      on all platforms including Windows.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content-Lite.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, t/content.t
     Per PDF::API2, deprecated lead() and replace by leading(). Lite's
      textlead() deprecated and replaced by textleading().

    t/text.t
     Per PDF::API2 add two tests for charspace and wordspace override, and
     18 more tests for basic text calls. 

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content/Text.pm, INFO/KNOWN_INCOMP
     Per PDF::API2, add paragraphs() as an alias for section(). Document some
      minor inconsistencies in option names and behavior introduced with
      these changes.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Dict-File.pm, 
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm, examples/041_annot_fileattach,
      examples/060_transparency, examples/resources/sample_55.pdf, 
      examples/resources/HarfBuzz_example.pdf
     Output 'endobj' starting its own line. Some PDF validators raise a
      stink if endobj continues a line with other commands on it. 
      While we're at it, put 'stream' starting its own line, too.
      Fix two examples that failed to validate. There is a third failure, but
      it appears to be an issue with PDF/A disallowed content (embedded files),
      not a bug in PDF production here.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Font/SynFont.pm, INFO/DEPRECATED, 
      examples/025_unifonts, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm
     Fix uninitialized value (missingwidth), remove -slant (deprecated).

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF.pm
     Corrected some bilevel color inverts.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF/File_GT.pm,
      lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/TIFF_GT.pm
     Some improvements to deal with inverted colors (black/white) on certain
      TIFF images. Now G3 and G4 (CCITT Fax) get flipped to the correct
      colors, as does uncompressed bilevel. There are still some TIFF cases 
      which are not fully properly dealt with; we are still working on them.
     
    lib/PDF/Builder/Annotation.pm, examples/040_annotation, 
      examples/041_annot_fileattach
     Add "-opacity" option to control the opacity (opaqueness) of the icon,
      where the default of 1.0 is fully opaque, and 0.0 is fully transparent.
      Add "markup" method to implement "highlighted" text annotations, per
      [GitHub #142]. These include "Highlight" (in the manner of a highlighter
      marker), "Squiggly" (squiggly underline), "Underline", and "StrikeOut".
      These behave like a "text" annotation, but instead of an icon, the
      document text is highlighted.

    lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm  improve -strikethru placement

    INFO/LICENSE, README.md, lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/Array-Bool-Dict-
      File-Filter-Name-Null-Number-Objind-Page-Pages-String-Utils.pm
     Update file headers on code originally written by Martin Hosken to
      reflect that he has granted permission to use the MIT license instead
      of the Perl Artistic License on his code. This change was made so
      that Red Hat could have licensing compatible with LGPL for releasing
      PDF::Builder as part of Fedora.
