     Update file headers on code originally written by Martin Hosken to
      reflect that he has granted permission to use the MIT license instead
      of the Perl Artistic License on his code. This change was made so
      that Red Hat could have licensing compatible with LGPL for releasing
      PDF::Builder as part of Fedora.
