3.027     2023-12-17  UNRELEASED
* = work in progress (not all may make it into this release!)

*   elliptical bogen and rotated ellipses/arcs/ebogens. Probably a new
       examples/Bogens.pl with circular bogen stuff moved over from Content.pl 
       and replaced by rotated arc examples in Content.pl. elliptical bogen
       examples in Bogens.pl

*   lc() all tags and attribute names in column() no need to do CSS properties
       (would not expect to be anything but lower case) although should also
       lc() tag names in <style> and global CSS inputs. make sure unsupported
       tags and CSS properties reported (at first occurrence, with flag to 
       suppress reporting... just ignore).

*   cleanup of column(), including list markers, dead code, CSS text-align
       before outputting font changes for <li>, output a 
       <span style="display:block;">marker text</span> before the <li>
       should use the <ul><ol> etc. font properties for the marker since is
       outside of <li></li> block. at some point, new extended properties
       for markers (default to ul, ol, etc. properties).

*   column() fix growth of font size in <a>. confirm that indentation etc.
       correct when crossing column boundaries

*   add <img> to column(), with positioning (as CSS compatible as possible) to
       align top/center/baseline/bottom with current text/line ascender-top/
       baseline/descender-bottom plus arbitrary point displacement dx and dy
       from current baseline starting point or from vertical alignment 
       setting). Don't forget to expand line max extents as needed.

*   some new tag and CSS support in column() esp white-space, pre, br #195
       <sl> and <dl> might be easy enough, too, once I'm happy with lists.
       <code>, <kbd>, <samp>, <var> so PDF::Table code display request done.

*   any margin-top at column top should be ignored, not just for <p>

*   extend CSS for list marker styling (bold italic, color, font, size, etc.).
       default to current ol, ul etc. styling property values.

*   avoid marooning ( ) etc. at end of line when under different tags (adjacent
       text/no space still splitting because tag changed near end of line)

*   GnuPlot support (depends on SVG image or PNG image). can do before SVG in.
       build GP file on the fly and/or extend an existing one. temp file for GP,
       temp file for output from gnuplot -- flag to name and preserve, or to
       discard temp file(s).

*   SVG support for image, once SVGPDF finalized. make sure GnuPlot now
       allows SVG output, not just PNG.

*   MathJax support (depends on SVG image). <eqn> tag in column(). as with
       GnuPlot, name and preserve temp output (SVG file) or discard.

*   make sure Docs.pm, Content::Text, and #195 list of supported tags, CSS
       properties, etc. are kept in synch with column() capabilities, as well 
       as changes to examples/ being transferred to site Examples section

*   vector (list) set AND get of transform matrix #200

*   remove leading 0's in various integers if encountered #198. test first to
       see if problem in PDF::Builder or in various Readers. Builder should not
       be creating such integers, but should modify them if read in from an
       external producer.

*   rationalize and document Named Destination support #202

*   precision of coordinate dimensions #196

*   revised bar code support (depends on new barcode library and SVG image) #48
       probably put off to 3.028, as requires new product release of large
       1D and 2D barcode SVG generator (as optional prereq for Builder).

    (most .pm files) update POD for more consistent appearance.
    docs/buildDoc.pl put NAVIGATION at top of TOC, since usually now much 
      more in the Table of Contents.
    devtools/PDFbuild.pl updates found to be needed in 3.026 build.
    devtools/html2php.pl updates found to be needed.
    MANIFEST add INFO/Changes_2023.

(see INFO/Changes_2023 for earlier changes)

Note that INFO/Changes-ver_2 (for changes released for PDF::API2, and 
incorporated into PDF::Builder) is NOT being updated any longer. You may
assume that any change logged for API2 has also been incorporated into
Builder, with any exceptions or differences noted here.
