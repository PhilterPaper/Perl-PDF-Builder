3.011     2018-08-24 (unreleased)

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/Basefont.pm-CIDFont.pm-UniFont.pm
    fix typo variable name $ident to $indent (indentation)
   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/UniFont.pm
    fix RT 126274/#96 (reporter: fcc_del) by adding missing indentation
     value to recursive text() call (rather than reporter's more complex fix).

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
    close RT 98539 (need to verify flatness function). According to PDF spec,
     there's no real way to tell by eye whether it's within tolerance, and
     results are unpredictable if you try to force visible line segments with
     a higher tolerance. Also update POD to clarify the range of permissible
     tolerance values, and silently clamp the input value to be in that range.

    move to new INFO/ directory, as things were starting to get a little
     crowded in the root directory. Changes and MANIFEST are used by the 
     system and can not be moved. MANIFEST updated to reflect new structure.

   Changes, Changes_2017, MANIFEST
     split up Change logs by year, to make them easier to handle.

   docs/, docs/buildDoc.pl, MANIFEST
     provide a tool and place to build the HTML pages from PODs in the
     PDF::Builder module sources. The .html files are NOT shipped with either
     the Perl build or on GitHub. 

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/XObject/Image/PNG.pm
     [ref RT 124349] code cleanup while looking at issue of why PNG RGBA
     processing is so incredibly slow. Suspect that the heavy use of the
     Perl vec() call may have something to do with it. To be continued...

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/Content.pl, examples/Bspline.pl, 
     t/content.t, MANIFEST, examples.bat
    [ref CTS 8] add "bspline" method to draw a smoothly continuous curve 
     (using blended cubic Bezier curves) through all the given points. In 
     addition, the first and/or last points may be specified as visible or 
     invisible straight line or curved segments in order to constrain the 
     spline's behavior at the endpoints.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm, examples/Content.pl, t/content.t, DEPRECATED
     [ref CTS 8] change "spline" method name to "qbspline", and deprecate 
     "spline". This is to reflect that this method is actually a piecewise 
     (non-continuous) series of quadratic Bezier curves, and not a true spline. 

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/Docs.pm, MANIFEST 
     Add POD commentary on input and output PDF version supported.
     Move POD function details out of Builder.pm to a lower level "Docs" 
       routine, in order to reduce the POD clutter.

   .perl-version, dist.ini.old, .travis.yml.HOLD, Makefile.PL, 
     lib/PDF/Builder.pm, lib/PDF/Builder/UniWrap.pm, MANIFEST
    change minimum Perl release level from 5.8.6 to Perl 5.16.0, per PDF::API2. 
     The intent is to "support major Perl versions released in the past six 
     years, plus one major release before that one. This should provide 
     backward compatibility for the life of most LTS server distributions, 
     while eliminating the need to troubleshoot warnings and bugs that only 
     show up in increasingly-ancient versions of Perl." For this release, it 
     means that the minimum supported Perl is 5.16 (first released 2012-05-20...
     see https://www.cpan.org/src/ "First release in each branch of Perl" for 
     dates, NOT "Latest releases in each branch of Perl"!). The next version 
     bump (to 5.18) should be after 2019-05-18.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Resource/CIDFont/TrueType/FontFile.pm
     use confess (Carp.pm) rather than die, per PDF::API2.

   examples/*, examples.bat
     moved output PDFs for several examples from the current directory to the 
     examples directory, in the same style as the rest of the example outputs. 
     Note that contrib.bat still outputs in the current directory.

    minor code styling changes to make perlcritic (level 5) happy. Some changes

    minor code styling changes to make perlcritic (level 4) happy, including 
     adding explicit "return" on all routines where missing, and not using 
     variables $a and $b ("magic" according to perlcritic). Some changes 
     suggested by PDF::API2 for this. There are many other level 4 errors yet 
     to be gotten rid of: "Code before warnings" and "Warnings disabled at" due 
     to use of "no warnings", "Close filehandles as soon as possible" due to 
     too many lines between "open" and "close" calls, "Always unpack @_ first" 
     (perlcritic doesn't like much about using the @_ array), "Subroutine name 
     is a homonym for a builtin function" (e.g., our own "open" in contrast to 
     CORE::open), "Symbols are exported by default" (doesn't like @EXPORT_OK 
     usage). Most other perlcritic level 4 complaints were permanently fixed, 
     but a few, such as "grep" and "map" formats, have been suppressed with 
     "no critic" statements. Those might be revisited later.

   pc.bat
     add batch file to run perlcritic

   lib/PDF/Builder/Page.pm
     a few minor code styling changes, per PDF::API2. Most of the PDF::API2 
     changes were already in PDF::Builder, and some I declined because the 
     style was not consistent.

   examples.bat, examples/024_bdffonts, examples/examples.output
     some minor improvements to bitmapped (BDF) display output. Bitmap font
     support is still _very_ buggy! Does anyone actually _use_ bitmapped fonts?

   lib/PDF/Builder.pm 
     stringify() make sure return value has at least empty string for content. 
     Several cases of -unicodemap check for true, not 1. After PDF::API2 
     changes for perlcritic.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Content.pm
     outobjdeep() check -docompress is true, not 1. bogen() explicitly default 
     move, larger, reverse to "false" (0). isvirtual(), ' apiistext' check for 
     true, not 1. After PDF::API2 changes for perlcritic.

   lib/PDF/Builder/Basic/PDF/File.pm
     add support for cross-reference streams (PDF 1.5) using 64-bit field 
     widths, per PDF::API2 changes.

   .travis.yml.HOLD, MANIFEST
     name restore (from .tgravis.yml). May attempt at some point to make use of 
     Travis for testing. Currently my system seems to not be supportive of
     Travis modules, and I don't have a Travis account. I vaguely recall the
     CPAN system trying to use .travis.yml in my first release, and requiring 
     an immediate release update, so I'm not using the name .travis.yml for now.
