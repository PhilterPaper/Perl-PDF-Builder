A list of DEPRECATED names and interfaces in PDF::Builder. These are sometimes
misspellings that have been corrected at some point in the past (in PDF::API2), 
although some are interfaces that have been removed. Rather than keeping the 
old names around forever, they will be sunset and removed in due time. Please 
periodically check this list and make sure you have plans to change or remove 
these deprecated usages before they disappear from PDF::Builder. Initially,
the deprecated items may only be commented out (so they can be restored by a
user in an emergency), but eventually they WILL be removed.

In order of scheduled removal date:

meterlimit      method in Content.pm and Resource/ExtGState.pm
   Misspelling, corrected to miterlimit. Use "miterlimit()" instead. A warning
   message is currently given. Scheduled to be removed on or after August, 2019.

hspace          method in Content.pm
   Misnamed, as it not an amount of horizontal space, but is a horizontal
   scaling factor. Use "hscale()" instead. A warning message is currently 
   given. Scheduled to be removed on or after August, 2019.

   It is POSSIBLE that after hspace() is removed, a NEW hspace() might appear
   for the purpose of adding some amount of horizontal space to a line of text,
   but there are no firm plans at this point. If such a method is added before
   the old hspace() is cold and dead, it would have to get a different name.

linedash -full and -clear options   method in Content.pm
   The dash pattern setting hash options "-full" and "-clear" are deprecated in
   favor of the "-pattern" array. A warning message is currently given. They 
   are scheduled to be removed on or after August, 2019.

   Also in t/deprecations.t
