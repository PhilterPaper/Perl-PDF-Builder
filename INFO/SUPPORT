PDF::Builder is a fork (July, 2017) of the popular PDF::API2 Perl 
software for PDF creation and manipulation. 

Why does it start with version 3.004? The owner of PDF::API2 requested 
that the name of the fork be changed from API2 to something else to 
avoid confusion. The author of Builder had originally offered this
software as another version of API2, and had already jumped the version
from 2.xxx (API2) to 3.xxx (now Builder) and had made three releases
(served from the catskilltech.com website). Rather than reset to 1.000, 
it seemed cleaner just to continue with the 3.xxx version.

PDF::Builder source is hosted on GitHub
(https://github.com/PhilterPaper/Perl-PDF-Builder), with the Perl
installable module download offered on CPAN (PDF::Builder). Many users can
directly install using a CPAN-compatible installer (e.g., 'cpan' on Strawberry
Perl, or 'cpanm').
