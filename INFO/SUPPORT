PDF::Builder is a fork (July, 2017) of the popular PDF::API2 Perl 
software for PDF creation and manipulation. 

Why does it start with version 3.004? The owner of PDF::API2 requested 
that the name of the fork be changed from API2 to something else to 
avoid confusion. The author of Builder had originally offered this
software as another version of API2, and had already jumped the version
from 2.xxx (API2) to 3.xxx (now Builder) and had made three releases
(served from the catskilltech.com website). Rather than reset to 1.000, 
it seemed cleaner just to continue with the 3.xxx version.

Currently, PDF::Builder source is hosted on GitHub
(https://github.com/PhilterPaper/Perl-PDF-Builder), with the Perl
installable module download offered on CPAN (PDF::Builder).

Please raise issues (bug reports, etc.) on GitHub, under the "issues" tab,
with label "bugs". Feature Requests should be labeled "enhancement". The 
maintainer will close (and tag as appropriate) resolved or rejected issues. 
Please do NOT use the CPAN RT ticket system -- it is not being regularly 
monitored by the owner.

General discussions not pertaining to a specific issue (bug) may be
conducted on the forum at https://www.catskilltech.com/forum/index.html
in the PDF::Builder/General Discussions board. Alternately, use the "general
discussion" label under the GitHub system. 

If you do not have a CPAN or GitHub account with which to open a ticket,
you can use my Contact form at the above forum URL. Look for a link "Post
without Account". This is provided as a convenience for those lacking a
GitHub ID (for submitting an issue) and only need it on an occasional
basis. If you end up using it regularly, I will have to ask you to open
a GitHub account so that you can post directly. Please indicate whether
you are trying to post a ticket (issue) for GitHub, an entry to a thread 
(or are starting a new thread) in the forum, or something else.
