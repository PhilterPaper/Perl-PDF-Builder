  Facilitates the creation and modification of PDF files

The installable Perl package may be obtained from https://www.cpan.org, 
as PDF::Builder. If you install this product, only the run-time modules will
be installed. Download the full .tar.gz file and unpack it (hint: on Windows,
7-Zip File Manager is an excellent tool) to get utilities, test buckets, 
example usage, etc.

Note that there are several "optional" libraries (Perl modules) used to extend
and improve PDF::Builder. The installation process MAY attempt to install them 
if not present (Makefile.PL "recommends" list). Don't panic if one or more 
fails to install -- PDF::Builder is still quite usable. Read about it in 
PDF::Builder::Docs. Conversely, if you need to use one or more, and they were
not automatically installed, you will need to manually initiate an install.

To build the full HTML documentation (all the POD), get the full installation
and go to the "docs" directory. Run "buildDoc.pl --all" to generate the full
tree of documentation. There's a lot of additional information in the 
PDF::Builder::Docs module (it's all documentation).

We admit that the documentation is a bit light on "how to" task orientation.
We hope to more fully address this in the future, but for now, get the full 
installation and look at the "examples" and "contrib" directories for sample 
code that may help you figure out how to do things. The installation tests in 
the "t" directory might also be useful to you.
