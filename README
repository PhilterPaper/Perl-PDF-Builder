  A Perl library to facilitate the creation and modification of PDF files

The installable Perl package may be obtained from https://www.cpan.org, 
as PDF::Builder. If you install this product, only the run-time modules will
be installed. Download the full .tar.gz file and unpack it (hint: on Windows,
7-Zip File Manager is an excellent tool) to get utilities, test buckets, 
example usage, etc.

Alternatively, you can obtain the full source files from
https://github.com/PhilterPaper/Perl-PDF-Builder, where the ticket list (bugs,
enhancement requests, etc.) is also kept. Unlike the installable CPAN version, 
this will have to be manually installed (copy files; there are no XS compiles
at this time).

Note that there are several "optional" libraries (Perl modules) used to extend
and improve PDF::Builder. The installation process will not attempt to install 
them if not present -- you need to do this manually (if you want to use them),
or at least, give the go-ahead during the installation process to try
installing them. Read about the list of optional libraries in 
PDF::Builder::Docs, and decide whether or not you want to install any of them.

REQUIREMENTS ======================================================

Perl 5.20 or higher. It will likely run on somewhat earlier versions, but 
  the CPAN installer may refuse to install it. The reason this version was
  chosen was so that LTS (Long Term Support) versions of Perl going back about
  6 years are officially supported (by PDF::Builder), and older versions are 
  not supported. The intent is to not waste time and effort trying to fix bugs
  which are an artifact of old Perl releases.

  If you MUST install on an older (pre 5.20) Perl, you can try the following
  for Strawberry Perl (Windows). NO PROMISES! Something similar MAY work for 
  other OS's and Perl installations:
    Unpack installation file (.tar.gz, via a utility such as 7-Zip) into a
      directory, and cd to that directory
    Edit .perl-version and change 5.20.0 to 5.16.0 or whatever level desired
    Edit Makefile.PL and change use 5.020000; to use 5.016000;
                         change $PERL_version from '5.020000' to '5.016000'
    cpan .

  Note that some Perl installers MAY have a means to override or suppress the
  Perl version check. That may be easier to use. Or, you may have to repack
  the edited directory back into a .tar.gz installable. YMMV.

  If all goes well, PDF::Builder will be installed on your system. Whether or
  not it will RUN is another matter. Please do NOT open a bug report (ticket)
  unless you're absolutely sure that the problem is not a result of using an
  old Perl release, e.g., PDF::Builder is using a feature introduced in Perl
  5.008 and you're trying to run Perl 5.002!

Libraries used, available from CPAN --

 REQUIRED, should be automatically installed...
  Compress::Zlib
  Font::TTF
  Test::Exception (needed only for installation tests)
  Test::Memory::Cycle (needed only for installation tests)

 OPTIONAL, install manually if wanted AND they failed to install 
  automatically when requested...
   Graphics::TIFF (recommended if using TIFF image functions)
   Image::PNG::Libpng (recommended for enhanced PNG image function processing)
   HarfBuzz::Shaper (recommended for Latin script ligatures and kerning, as
                    well as for any complex script such as Arabic, Indic
                    scripts, or Khmer)

Other than an installer for standard CPAN packages (such as 'cpan' on
Strawberry Perl for Windows), no other tools or manually-installed prereqs
are needed (worst case, you can unpack the .tar.gz file and copy files into
place yourself!). Currently there are no compiles and links (Perl extensions)
done during the install process, only copying of .pm Perl module files.

INFO/old/ also has some build and test tool files that are not currently used.

To build the full HTML documentation (all the POD), get the full installation
and go to the "docs" directory. Run "buildDoc.pl --all" to generate the full
tree of documentation. There's a lot of additional information in the 
PDF::Builder::Docs module (it's all documentation).

We admit that the documentation is a bit light on "how to" task orientation.
We hope to more fully address this in the future, but for now, get the full 
installation and look at the "examples" and "contrib" directories for sample 
code that may help you figure out how to do things. The installation tests in 
the "t" directory might also be useful to you.
