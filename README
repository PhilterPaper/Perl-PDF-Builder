  Facilitates the creation and modification of PDF files

The installable Perl package may be obtained from https://www.cpan.org, 
as PDF::Builder.

Note that there are several "optional" libraries (Perl modules) used to extend
and improve PDF::Builder. The installation process MAY attempt to install them 
if not present (Makefile.PL "recommends" list). Don't panic if one or more 
fails to install -- PDF::Builder is still quite usable. Read about it in 
PDF::Builder::Docs. Conversely, if you need to use one or more, and they were
not automatically installed, you will need to manually initiate an install.
