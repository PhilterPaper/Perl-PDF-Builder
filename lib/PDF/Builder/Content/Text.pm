=head1 NAME

PDF::Builder::Content::Text - additional specialized text-related formatting methods. Inherits from L<PDF::Builder::Content>

B<Note:> If you have used some of these methods in PDF::API2 with a I<graphics> 
type object (e.g., $page->gfx()->method()), you may have to change to a I<text> 
type object (e.g., $page->text()->method()).

    return $self;
}

=over

=item $width = $content->text_left($text, %opts)

=item $width = $content->text_left($text)

Alias for C<text>. Implemented for symmetry, for those who use a lot of
C<text_center> and C<text_right>, and desire a C<text_left>.

Adds text to the page (left justified). 
The width used (in points) is B<returned>.

=back

=cut

sub text_left {
    my ($self, $text, @opts) = @_;

    return $self->text($text, @opts);
}

=over

=item $width = $content->text_center($text, %opts)

=item $width = $content->text_center($text)

As C<text>, but centered on the current point.

Adds text to the page (centered). 
The width used (in points) is B<returned>.

=back

=cut

sub text_center {
    my ($self, $text, @opts) = @_;

    my $width = $self->advancewidth($text);

}

=over

=item $width = $content->text_right($text, %opts)

=item $width = $content->text_right($text)

As C<text>, but right-aligned to the current point.

Adds text to the page (right justified). 
The width used (in points) is B<returned>.

=back

=cut

sub text_right {
    my ($self, $text, @opts) = @_;

    my $width = $self->advancewidth($text);

}

=over

=item $width = $content->text_justified($text, $width, %opts)
 
=item $width = $content->text_justified($text, $width)

As C<text>, but stretches text (using C<wordspace>, C<charspace>, and (as a  
last resort) C<hscale>) to fill the desired
(available) C<$width>. Note that if the desired width is I<less> than the
natural width taken by the text, it will be I<condensed> to fit, using the
same three routines.

The unchanged C<$width> is B<returned>, unless there was some reason to
change it (e.g., overflow).

B<Options:>

=over

=item -wordsp => value

The percentage of one space character (default 100) that is the maximum amount
to add to (each) interword spacing to expand the line.

=item -charsp => value

If adding interword space didn't do enough, the percentage of one em (default 
100) that is the maximum amount to add to (each) intercharacter spacing to 
further expand the line.

=item -wordspa => value

If adding intercharacter space didn't do enough, the percentage of one space
character (default 100) that is the maximum I<additional> amount to add to 
(each) interword spacing to further expand the line.

=item -charspa => value

If adding more interword space didn't do enough, the percentage of one em 
(default 100) that is the maximum I<additional> amount to add to (each) 
intercharacter spacing to further expand the line.

=item -condw => value

The percentage of one space character (default 25) that is the maximum amount
to subtract from (each) interword spacing to condense the line.

=item -condc => value

If removing interword space didn't do enough, the percentage of one em
(default 10) that is the maximum amount to subtract from (each) intercharacter
spacing to further condense the line.

=back

If expansion (or reduction) wordspace and charspace changes didn't do enough 
to make the line fit the desired width, use C<hscale()> to finish expanding or 
condensing the line to fit.

=head2 Multiple Lines from a String

The string is split at regular blanks (spaces), x20, to find the longest 
substring that will fit the C<$width>. 
If a single word is longer than C<$width>, it will overflow. 
To stay strictly within the desired bounds, set the option
C<-spillover>=>0 to disallow spillover.

=head3 Hyphenation

If hyphenation is enabled, those methods which split up a string into multiple
lines (the "text fill", paragraph, and section methods) will attempt to split
up the word that overflows the line, in order to pack the text even more
tightly ("greedy" line splitting). There are a number of controls over where a
word may be split, but note that there is nothing language-specific (i.e.,
following a given language's rules for where a word may be split). This is left
to other packages.

There are hard coded minimums of 2 letters before the split, and 2 letters after
the split. See C<Hyphenate_basic.pm>. Note that neither hyphenation nor simple
line splitting makes any attempt to prevent widows and orphans, prevent 
splitting of the last word in a column or page, or otherwise engage in 
I<paragraph shaping>.

=over

=item -hyphenate => value

0: no hyphenation (B<default>), 1: do basic hyphenation. Always allows
splitting at a soft hyphen (\xAD). Unicode hyphen (U+2010) and non-splitting
hyphen (U+2011) are ignored as split points.

=item -spHH => value

0: do I<not> split at a hard hyphen (x\2D), 1: I<OK to split> (B<default>)

=item -spOP => value

0: do I<not> split after most punctuation, 1: I<OK to split> (B<default>)

=item -spDR => value

0: do I<not> split after a run of one or more digits, 1: I<OK to split> (B<default>)

=item -spLR => value

0: do I<not> split after a run of one or more ASCII letters, 1: I<OK to split> (B<default>)

=item -spCC => value

0: do I<not> split in camelCase between a lowercase letter and an
uppercase letter, 1: I<OK to split> (B<default>)

=item $overflow_text = $txt->paragraph($text, $width,$height, $continue, %opts)

=item $overflow_text = $txt->paragraph($text, $width,$height, $continue)

Print a single string into a rectangular area on the page, of given width and
maximum height. The baseline of the first (top) line is at the current text
position.

Apply the text within the rectangle and B<return> any leftover text (if could 
not fit all of it within the rectangle). If called in an array context, the 
unused height is also B<returned> (may be 0 or negative if it just filled the 
rectangle).

If C<$continue> is 1, the first line does B<not> get special treatment for
indenting or outdenting, because we're printing the continuation of the 
paragraph that was interrupted earlier. If it's 0, the first line may be 
indented or outdented.

B<Options:>

=over

=item -pndnt => $indent

Give the amount of indent (positive) or outdent (negative, for "hanging")
for paragraph first lines). This setting is ignored for centered text.

=item -align => $choice

C<$choice> is 'justified', 'right', 'center', 'left'; the default is 'left'.

=item -underline => $distance

=item -underline => [ $distance, $thickness, ... ]

If a scalar, distance below baseline,
else array reference with pairs of distance and line thickness.

=item -spillover => $over

Controls if words in a line which exceed the given width should be 
"spilled over" the bounds, or if a new line should be used for this word.

C<$over> is 1 or 0, with the default 1 (spills over the width).

=back

B<Example:>

    $txt->font($font,$fontsize);
    $txt->lead($lead);
    $txt->translate($x,$y);
    $overflow = $txt->paragraph( 'long paragraph here ...',
                                 $width,
                                 $y+$lead-$bottom_margin );

B<Note:> if you need to change any text treatment I<within> a paragraph 
(B<bold> or I<italicized> text, for instance), this can not handle it. Only 
plain text (all the same font, size, etc.) can be typeset with C<paragraph()>.
Also, there is currently very limited line splitting (hypenation) to better 
fit to a given width, and nothing is done for "widows and orphans".

The C<$text> contains a string with one or more paragraphs C<$width> wide, 
starting at the current text position, with a newline \n between each 
paragraph. Each paragraph is output (see C<paragraph>) until the C<$height> 
limit is met (a partial paragraph may be at the bottom). Whatever wasn't 
output, will be B<returned>.
If called in an array context, the 
unused height and the paragraph "continue" flag are also B<returned>.

C<$continue> is 0 for the first call of section(), and then use the value 
returned from the previous call (1 if a paragraph was cut in the middle) to 
prevent unwanted indenting or outdenting of the first line being printed.

B<Options:>

=over

=item -pvgap => $vertical

Additional vertical space (unit: pt) between paragraphs (default 0). Note that this space
will also be added after the last paragraph printed.
