=head1 NAME

PDF::Builder::Content::Hyphenate_basic - Simple hyphenation capability

=head1 SYNOPSIS

These are internal routines that are somewhat experimental, and may (or may
not) be extended in the future. They are called from various Content routines
that take long strings of text and split them into fixed-length lines.

Words are split to fill the line most completely, without regard to widows and
orphans, long runs of hyphens at the right edge, "rivers" of space flowing
through a paragraph, and other problems. Also, only simple splitting is done
(not actually I<words>), on a simple, language-independent basis. No dictionary 
or rules-based splitting is currently done.

This functionality may well be replaced by "hooks" to call language-specific
word-splitting rules, as well as worrying about the appearance of the results
(such as Knuth-Plass).
