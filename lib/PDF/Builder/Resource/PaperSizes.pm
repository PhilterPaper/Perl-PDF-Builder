=head1 NAME

PDF::Builder::Resource::PaperSizes - list of standard paper sizes and their dimensions

=head2 Information and Usage

This is a list of standard page (media) sizes by I<name> (e.g., 'A4' or 
'Legal'), given by width and height in Big Points (72 per inch). See the code 
in PaperSizes.pm for the actual entries. You do B<not> have to use these names; 
they are merely provided as convenient shortcuts. You can always specify the 
desired dimensions (in points) yourself.

The PDF specification (and PDF readers) default to US Letter size (portrait
orientation, 8.5 inches wide by 11 inches high). If you want to use anything
else, you will have to make a C<mediabox()> call to specify the media (paper)
size. For named sizes, capitalization doesn't matter (all entries are folded 
to lower case, so 'A4' and 'a4' work the same).

Different sources give somewhat different paper dimensions, especially for
archaic or unusual sizes, so take care and measure your actual paper before
printing, so you can avoid wasting paper and time printing to the wrong 
mediabox! Also keep in mind that many printers cannot print all the way to the
edge (don't want to get ink or toner on the paper rollers), so set your margins
accordingly.
