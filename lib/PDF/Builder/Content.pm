=head1 NAME

PDF::Builder::Content - Methods for adding graphics and text to a PDF

Inherits from L<PDF::Builder::Basic::PDF::Dict>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Start with a PDF page (new or opened)
    my $pdf = PDF::Builder->new();
    my $page = $pdf->page();

    # Add new content object(s)
    my $content = $page->graphics();  # or gfx()
    #   and/or (as separate object name)
    my $content = $page->text();

    # Then call the methods below to add graphics and text to the page.
    # Note that negative coordinates can have unpredictable effects, so
    # keep your coordinates non-negative!

These methods add content to I<streams> output for text or graphics objects.
Unless otherwise restricted by a check that we are in or out of text mode,
many methods listed here apply equally to text and graphics streams. It is
possible that there I<are> some which have no effect in one stream type or
the other, but are currently lacking a check to prevent them from being 
inserted into an inapplicable stream.

=head1 METHODS

All public methods listed, I<except as otherwise noted,> return C<$self>,
for ease of chaining calls.

=head2 Coordinate Transformations

The methods in this section change the coordinate system for the
current content object relative to the rest of the document.
B<Note:> the changes are relative to the I<original> page coordinates (and 
thus, absolute), not to the previous position! Thus, C<translate(10, 10); 
translate(10, 10);> ends up only moving the origin to C<[10, 10]>, rather than 
to C<[20, 20]>. There is one call, C<transform_rel()>, which makes your changes 
I<relative> to the previous position.

If you call more than one of these methods, the PDF specification
recommends calling them in the following order: translate, rotate,
scale, skew.  Each change builds on the last, and you can get
unexpected results when calling them in a different order.

B<CAUTION:> a I<text> object ($content) behaves a bit differently. Individual
translate, rotate, scale, and skew calls I<cancel out> any previous settings.
If you want to combine multiple transformations for text, use the C<transform>
call.

=head3 translate

    $content->translate($dx,$dy)

=over

Moves the origin along the x and y axes to 
C<$dx> and C<$dy> respectively.

=back

=cut

sub _translate {
    my ($x,$y) = @_;

    return (1,0,0,1, $x,$y);
}

# transform in turn calls _translate
sub translate {
    my ($self, $x,$y) = @_;

    $self->transform('translate' => [$x,$y]);

    return $self;
}

=head3 rotate

    $content->rotate($degrees)

=over

Rotates the coordinate system counter-clockwise (anti-clockwise) around the
current origin. Use a negative argument to rotate clockwise. Note that 360 
degrees will be treated as 0 degrees.

B<Note:> Unless you have already moved (translated) the origin, it is, and will
remain, at the lower left corner of the visible sheet. It will I<not>
automatically shift to another corner. For example, a rotation of +90 degrees
(counter-clockwise) will leave the entire visible sheet in negative Y territory (0 at the left edge, -original_width at the right edge), while X remains in
positive territory (0 at bottom, +original_height at the top edge).

This C<rotate()> call permits any angle. Do not confuse it with the I<page>
rotation C<rotate> call, which only permits increments of 90 degrees (with
opposite sign!), but I<does> shift the origin to another corner of the sheet.

=back

=cut

sub _rotate {
    my ($deg) = @_;

    return (cos(deg2rad($deg)), sin(deg2rad($deg)), -sin(deg2rad($deg)), cos(deg2rad($deg)), 0,0);
}

# transform in turn calls _rotate
sub rotate {
    my ($self, $deg) = @_;

    $self->transform('rotate' => $deg);

    return $self;
}

=head3 scale

    $content->scale($sx,$sy)

=over

Scales (stretches) the coordinate systems along the x and y axes.
Separate multipliers are provided for x and y.

=back

=cut

sub _scale {
    my ($sx,$sy) = @_;

    return ($sx,0,0,$sy, 0,0);
}

# transform in turn calls _scale
sub scale {
    my ($self, $sx,$sy) = @_;

    $self->transform('scale' => [$sx,$sy]);

    return $self;
}

=head3 skew

    $content->skew($skx,$sky)

=over

Skews the coordinate system by C<$skx> degrees 
(counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise) from
the x axis I<and> C<$sky> degrees (clockwise) from the y axis.
Note that 360 degrees will be treated the same as 0 degrees.

=back

=cut

sub _skew {
    my ($skx,$sky) = @_;

    return (1, tan(deg2rad($skx)), tan(deg2rad($sky)), 1, 0,0);
}

# transform in turn calls _skew
sub skew {
    my ($self, $skx,$sky) = @_;

    $self->transform('skew' => [$skx,$sky]);

    return $self;
}

=head3 transform

    $content->transform(%opts)

=over

Use one or more of the given %opts:

    $content->transform(
        'translate' => [$dx,$dy],
        'rotate'    => $degrees,
        'scale'     => [$sx,$sy],
        'skew'      => [$skx,$sky],
        'matrix'    => [$a, $b, $c, $d, $e, $f],
        'point'     => [$x,$y]
	'repeat'    => $boolean
    )

A six element list may be given (C<matrix>) for a 
further transformation matrix:

    $a = cos(rot) * scale factor for X 
    $b = sin(rot) * tan(skew for X)
    $c = -sin(rot) * tan(skew for Y)
    $d = cos(rot) * scale factor for Y 
    $e = translation for X
    $f = translation for Y

Performs multiple coordinate transformations in one call, in the order
recommended by the PDF specification (translate, rotate, scale, skew).
This is equivalent to making each transformation separately, I<in the
indicated order>.
A matrix of 6 values may also be given (C<matrix>). The transformation matrix 
is updated. 
A C<point> may be given (a point to be multiplied [transformed] by the 
completed matrix).
Omitted options will be unchanged.

If C<repeat> is true, and if this is not the first call to a transformation
method, the previous transformation will be performed again, modified by any
other provided arguments.

=head2 Graphics State Parameters

The following calls also affect the B<text> state.

=head3 linewidth, line_width

    $content->linewidth($width)

=over

Sets the width of the stroke (in points). This is the line drawn in graphics 
mode, or the I<outline> of a character in text mode (with appropriate C<render> 
mode). If no C<$width> is given, the current setting is B<returned>. If the 
width is being set, C<$self> is B<returned> so that calls may be chained.

B<Alternate name:> C<line_width>

This is provided for compatibility with PDF::API2.

=back

    my ($linewidth) = @_;

    return ($linewidth, 'w');

	return $self->{' linewidth'};
    }
    $self->add(_linewidth($linewidth));
    $self->{' linewidth'} = $linewidth;

    return $self;
}

=head3 linecap, line_cap

    $content->linecap($style)

=over

Sets the style to be used at the end of a stroke. This applies to lines
which come to a free-floating end, I<not> to "joins" ("corners") in 
polylines (see C<linejoin>).

B<Alternate name:> C<line_cap>

This is provided for compatibility with PDF::API2.

=over

=item "butt" or "b" or 0 = Butt Cap (default)

The stroke ends at the end of the path, with no projection.

=item "round" or "r" or 1 = Round Cap

A semicircular arc is drawn around the end of the path with a diameter equal to
the line width, and is filled in.

=item "square" or "s" or 2 = Projecting Square Cap

The stroke continues past the end of the path for half the line width.

=back

If no C<$style> is given, the current setting is B<returned>. If the style is
being set, C<$self> is B<returned> so that calls may be chained.

Either a number or a string (case-insensitive) may be given.

=head3 linejoin, line_join

    $content->linejoin($style)

=over

Sets the style of join to be used at corners of a path
(within a multisegment polyline).

B<Alternate name:> C<line_join>

This is provided for compatibility with PDF::API2.

=over

=item "miter" or "m" or 0 = Miter Join, default

The outer edges of the strokes extend until they meet, up to the limit
specified by I<miterlimit>. If the limit would be surpassed, a I<bevel> join
is used instead. For a given linewidth, the more acute the angle is (closer
to 0 degrees), the higher the ratio of miter length to linewidth will be, and 
that's what I<miterlimit> controls -- a very "pointy" join is replaced by
a bevel.

=item "round" or "r" or 1 = Round Join

A filled circle with a diameter equal to the I<linewidth> is drawn around the
corner point, producing a rounded corner. The arc will meet up with the sides
of the line in a smooth tangent.

=item "bevel" or "b" or 2 = Bevel Join

A filled triangle is drawn to fill in the notch between the two strokes.

=back

If no C<$style> is given, the current setting is B<returned>. If the style is
being set, C<$self> is B<returned> so that calls may be chained.

    $content->miterlimit($ratio)

=over

Sets the miter limit when the line join style is a I<miter> join.

The ratio is the maximum length of the miter (inner to outer corner) divided 
by the line width. Any miter above this ratio will be converted to a I<bevel> 
join. The practical effect is that lines meeting at shallow
angles are chopped off instead of producing long pointed corners.

The default miter limit is 10.0 (approximately 11.5 degree cutoff angle).
The smaller the limit, the larger the cutoff angle.

If no C<$ratio> is given, the current setting is B<returned>. If the ratio is
being set, C<$self> is B<returned> so that calls may be chained.

B<Alternate name:> C<miter_limit>

Long ago, in a distant galaxy, this method was misnamed I<meterlimit>, but

    $content->linedash('pattern' => [$dash_length, $gap_length, ...], 'shift' => $offset)

=over

Sets the line dash pattern.

If called without any arguments, a solid line will be drawn.

If called with one argument, the dashes and gaps (strokes and
spaces) will have equal lengths.

If called with two or more arguments, the arguments represent
alternating dash and gap lengths.

If called with a hash of arguments, the I<pattern> array may have one or
more elements, specifying the dash and gap lengths. 
A dash phase may be set (I<shift>), which is a B<positive integer>
specifying the distance into the pattern at which to start the dashed line.
Note that if you wish to give a I<shift> amount, using C<shift>,
you need to use C<pattern> instead of one or two elements.

If an B<odd> number of dash array elements are given, the list is repeated by 
the reader software to form an even number of elements (pairs). 

If a single argument of B<-1> is given, the current setting is B<returned>. 
This is an array consisting of two elements: an anonymous array containing the 
dash pattern (default: empty), and the shift (offset) amount (default: 0). 
It may be used directly in a linedash() call, as linedash will recognize the 
special pattern [ array, number ].

If the dash pattern is being I<set>, C<$self> is B<returned> so that calls may 
be chained.

The current position is changed to the last C<[$x,$y]> pair given.

The difference between a polyline and a C<line> with multiple C<[$x,$y]>

Also, C<line_join> instead of C<line_cap> is used to control the appearance

Note that this is the I<starting> point of the rectangle, not the end point.
The object (here, C<$content>) is returned, to permit chaining.

=head4 pie

    $content->pie($xc,$yc, $rx,$ry, $alpha,$beta)

=over

Creates a pie-shaped path from an ellipse centered on C<[$xc,$yc]>.
The x-axis and y-axis semidiameters of the ellipse are C<$rx> and C<$ry>,
respectively, and the arc sweeps from C<$alpha> degrees to C<$beta>
degrees. 
It does not change the current position.
Depending on the sweep angles and direction, this can draw either the
pie "slice" or the remaining pie (with slice removed).
Use C<$rx == $ry> for a circular pie.
Use a different C<[$xc,$yc]> for the slice, to offset it from the remaining pie.

The optional C<$dir> arc sweep direction defaults to 0 (I<false>), for a
counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise sweep. Set to 1 (I<true>) for a clockwise
sweep.

This is a shortcut to draw a section of elliptical (or circular) arc and
connect it to the center of the ellipse or circle, to form a pie shape.

This extends the path in a curve from the current point to C<[$x,$y]>,

updates the current position to be the new point (C<[$x,$y]>).

Within a B<text> object, the text's baseline follows the Bezier curve.

Note that while multiple sets of three C<[x,y]> pairs are permitted, these
are treated as I<independent> cubic Bezier curves. There is no attempt made to
smoothly blend one curve into the next!

=head4 qbspline, spline

    $content->qbspline($cx1,$cy1, $x,$y)

=over

This extends the path in a curve from the current point to C<[$x,$y]>,
using the two specified points to create a quadratic Bezier curve, and updates 
the current position to be the new point.

Internally, these splines are one or more cubic Bezier curves (see C<curve>) 
with the two control points synthesized from the two given points (a control 
point and the end point of a I<quadratic> Bezier curve).

Note that while multiple sets of two C<[x,y]> pairs are permitted, these
are treated as I<independent> quadratic Bezier curves. There is no attempt 
made to smoothly blend one curve into the next!

Further note that this "spline" does not match the common definition of
a spline being a I<continuous> curve passing I<through> B<all> the given 
points! It is a piecewise non-continuous cubic Bezier curve. Use with care, and 
do not make assumptions about splines for you or your readers. You may wish
to use the C<bspline> call to have a continuously smooth spline to pass through
all given points.

Pairs of points (control point and end point) are consumed in a loop. If one 
point or coordinate is left over at the end, it is discarded (as usual practice
for excess data to a routine). There is no check for duplicate points or other 
degeneracies.

B<Alternate name:> C<spline>

This method is still named C<spline> in PDF::API2, so for compatibility, that
name is usable here. Since there are both quadratic and cubic splines available
in PDF, it is preferred to use more descriptive names such as C<qbspline> and
C<cbspline> to minimize confusion.

=head4 bspline, cbspline

    $content->bspline($ptsRef, %opts)

=over

This extends the path in a curve from the current point to the end of a list
of coordinate pairs in the array referenced by C<$ptsRef>. Smoothly continuous
cubic Bezier splines are used to create a curve that passes through I<all>
the given points. Multiple control points are synthesized; they are not 
supplied in the call. The current position is updated to the last point.

Internally, these splines are one cubic Bezier curve (see C<curve>) per pair
of input points, with the two control points synthesized from the tangent 
through each point as set by the polyline that would connect each point to its
neighbors. The intent is that the resulting curve should follow reasonably 
closely a polyline that would connect the points, and should avoid any major 
excursions. See the discussions below for the handling of the control points
at the endpoints (current point and last input point). The point at the end
of the last line or curve drawn becomes the new current point.

Options %opts:

=back

=over

=item 'firstseg' => 'I<mode>'

where I<mode> is 

=over

=item curve

This is the B<default> behavior.
This forces the first segment (from the current point to the first given point)
to be drawn as a cubic Bezier curve. This means that the direction of the curve
coming off the current point is unconstrained (it will end up being a reflection
of the tangent at the first given point).

=item line1

This forces the first segment (from the current point to the first given point)
to be drawn as a curve, with the tangent at the current point to be constrained 
as parallel to the polyline segment. 

=item line2

This forces the first segment (from the current point to the first given point)
to be drawn as a line segment. This also sets the tangent through the first
given point as a continuation of the line, as well as constraining the direction
of the line at the current point.

=item constraint1

This forces the first segment (from the current point to the first given point)
to B<not> be drawn, but to be an invisible curve (like mode=line1) to leave
the tangent at the first given point unconstrained. A I<move> will be made to 
the first given point, and the current point is otherwise ignored.

=item constraint2

This forces the first segment (from the current point to the first given point)
to B<not> be drawn, but to be an invisible line (like mode=line2) to constrain
the tangent at the first given point. A I<move> will be made to the first given
point, and the current point is otherwise ignored.

=back

=item 'lastseg' => 'I<mode>'

where I<mode> is 

=over

=item curve

This is the B<default> behavior.
This forces the last segment (to the last given input point)
to be drawn as a cubic Bezier curve. This means that the direction of the curve
goin to the last point is unconstrained (it will end up being a reflection
of the tangent at the next-to-last given point).

=item line1

This forces the last segment (to the last given input point) to be drawn as a 
curve with the the tangent through the last given point parallel to the 
polyline segment, thus constraining the direction of the line at the last 
point.

=item line2

This forces the last segment (to the last given input point)
to be drawn as a line segment. This also sets the tangent through the 
next-to-last given point as a back continuation of the line, as well as 
constraining the direction of the line at the last point.

=item constraint1

This forces the last segment (to the last given input point)
to B<not> be drawn, but to be an invisible curve (like mode=line1) to leave
the tangent at the next-to-last given point unconstrained. The last given 
input point is ignored, and next-to-last point becomes the new current point.

=item constraint2

This forces the last segment (to the last given input point)
to B<not> be drawn, but to be an invisible line (like mode=line2) to constrain
the tangent at the next-to-last given point. The last given input point is
ignored, and next-to-last point becomes the new current point.

=back

=item 'ratio' => I<n>

I<n> is the ratio of the length from a point to a control point to the length
of the polyline segment on that side of the given point. It must be greater
than 0.1, and the default is 0.3333 (1/3).

=item 'colinear' => 'I<mode>'

This describes how to handle the middle segment when there are four or more 
colinear points in the input set. A I<mode> of 'line' specifies that a line 
segment will be drawn between each of the interior colinear points. A I<mode> 
of 'curve' (this is the default) will draw a Bezier curve between each of those 
points.

C<colinear> applies only to interior runs of colinear points, between curves. 
It does not apply to runs at the beginning or end of the point list, which are
drawn as line segments or linear constraints regardless of I<firstseg> and 
I<lastseg> settings.

=item 'debug' => I<N>

If I<N> is 0 (the default), only the spline is returned. If it is greater than
0, a number of additional items will be drawn: (N>0) the points, (N>1) a green 
solid polyline connecting them, (N>2) blue original tangent lines at each 
interior point, and (N>3) red dashed lines and hollow points representing the 
Bezier control points.

=back

=over

B<Special cases>

Adjacent points which are duplicates are consolidated. 
An extra coordinate at the end of the input point list (not a full 
C<[x,y]> pair) will, as usual, be ignored.

=back

=over

=item 0 given points (after duplicate consolidation)

This leaves only the current point (unchanged), so it is a no-op.

=item 1 given point (after duplicate consolidation)

This leaves the current point and one point, so it is rendered as a line,
regardless of %opt flags.

=item 2 given points (after duplicate consolidation)

This leaves the current point, an intermediate point, and the end point. If
the three points are colinear, two line segments will be drawn. Otherwise, both
segments are curves (through the tangent at the intermediate point). If either
end segment mode is requested to be a line or constraint, it is treated as a 
B<line1> mode request instead. 

=item I<N> colinear points at beginning or end 

I<N> colinear points at beginning or end of the point set causes I<N-1> line 
segments (C<line2> or C<constraint2>, regardless of the settings of 
C<firstseg>, C<lastseg>, and C<colinear>.

I<quadratic> Bezier spline (see C<qbspline> above).

(I<bogen> is German for I<bow>, as in a segment (arc) of a circle. This is a 
segment of a circle defined by the intersection of two circles of a given 
radius, with the two intersection points as inputs. There are B<four> possible 
resulting arcs, which can be selected with C<$larger> and C<$reverse>.)

This extends the path along an arc of a circle of the specified radius
between C<[$x1,$y1]> to C<[$x2,$y2]>. The current position is then set
to the endpoint of the arc (C<[$x2,$y2]>).

Set C<$move> to a I<true> value if this arc is the beginning of a new
path instead of the continuation of an existing path. Note that the default 
(C<$move> = I<false>) is
I<not> a straight line to I<P1> and then the arc, but a blending into the curve
from the current point. It will often I<not> pass through I<P1>!

Set C<$larger> to a I<true> value to draw the larger ("outer") arc between the 
two points, instead of the smaller one. Both arcs are drawn I<clockwise> from 
I<P1> to I<P2>. The default value of I<false> draws the smaller arc.
Note that the "other" circle's larger arc is used (the center point is 
"flipped" across the line between I<P1> and I<P2>), rather than using the 
"remainder" of the smaller arc's circle (which would necessitate reversing the
direction of travel along the arc -- see C<$reverse>).

Set C<$reverse> to a I<true> value to draw the mirror image of the
specified arc (flip it over, so that its center point is on the other
side of the line connecting the two points). Both arcs are drawn
I<counter-clockwise> from I<P1> to I<P2>. The default (I<false>) draws 
clockwise arcs. An arc is B<always> drawn from I<P1> to I<P2>; the direction
(clockwise or counter-clockwise) may be chosen.

The C<$radius> value cannot be smaller than B<half> the distance from 
C<[$x1,$y1]> to C<[$x2,$y2]>. If it is too small, the radius will be set to
half the distance between the points (resulting in an arc that is a
semicircle). This is a silent error, as even if the points are correct, due
to rounding etc. they may not fall I<exactly> on the two circles.

You can think of "looking" from I<P1> to I<P2>. In the dengenerate case, where
the radius is exactly half the distance between the points, there is no
difference between "small" and "large" arcs, and both cirles will coincide
with their center half way between I<P1> and I<P2>. Only the direction matters.
Once the radius is any larger, the two circles become distinct. The primary 
circle is centered to your right, whose small arc is CW on your left; the 
secondary circle is centered to your left, whose small arc is CCW on your 
right. The "large" arcs are the arcs using the remainder of the circles: CW 
large is part of the left (secondary) circle, and CCW large is part of the 
right (primary) circle.

Modifies the current clipping path by intersecting it with the current
path. Initially (a fresh page), the clipping path is the entire media. Each

If the path intersects with itself, the I<nonzero> winding rule will be

situations depending on the direction of the path.

It is common usage to make the 
C<endpath()> call (B<n>) after the C<clip()> call, to clear the path (unless 
you want to reuse that path, such as to fill and/or stroke it to show the clip 
path). If you want to clip text glyphs, it gets rather complicated, as a clip
port cannot be created within a text object (that will have an effect on text).

    $content->fillcolor('%FF000000');   # cyan
    # Note: you might wish to make use of packages such as 
    #  HashData::Color::PantoneToCMYK to map "Pantone" color names/codes to a 
    #  set of CMYK values

    # Use an HSV color (! followed by 3, 6, 9, or 12 hex digits)
    # -> RGB color model
    # This maps to 0-360 degrees for the hue, and 0-1.0 values for 
    # saturation and value

    $content->fillcolor('$FF0000');

In all cases, if too few digits are given, the given digits
are silently right-padded with 0's (zeros). If an incorrect number 
of digits are given, the next lowest number of expected
digits are used, and the remaining digits are silently ignored.

    # A single number between 0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white) is an alternate way
    # of specifying a gray scale.

    # a CMYK color.
    $content->fillcolor(0.1, 0.9, 0.3, 1.0);

In all cases, if a number is less than 0, it is silently turned into a 0. If
a number is greater than 1, it is silently turned into a 1. This "clamps" all
values to the range 0.0-1.0.

    # A single reference is treated as a pattern or shading space.

    # Two or more entries with the first element a Perl reference, is treated 
    # as either an indexed colorspace reference plus color-index(es), or

Places an image on the page in the specified location (specifies the lower 
left corner of the image). The default location is C<[0,0]>.

If coordinate transformations have been made (see I<Coordinate
Transformations> above), the position and scale will be relative to the
updated coordinates. Otherwise, C<[0,0]> will represent the bottom left
corner of the page, and C<$width> and C<$height> will be measured at
72dpi.

For example, if you have a 600x600 image that you would like to be
shown at 600dpi (i.e., one inch square), set the width and height to 72.
(72 Big Points is one inch)

If passed the output of C<image_svg()>, C<image()> will simply pass it on to
the C<object()> method, with adjusted parameters. Note that this usage 
requires that the C<width> and C<height> are replaced by C<scale_x> and
C<scale_y> values (optionally).

Places an XObject on the page in the specified location (giving the lower
left corner of the image) and scale (applied to the image's native height
and width). If no scale is given, use 1 for both X and Y. If one scale is 
given, use for both X and Y.  If two scales given, they are for (separately) 
X and Y. In general, you should not greatly distort an image by using greatly 
different scaling factors in X and Y, although it is now possible for when 
that effect is desirable. The C<$x,$y> default is C<[0,0]>.

B<Note> that while this method is named form I<image>, it is also used for the 
pseudoimages created by the barcode routines. Images are naturally dimensionless
(1 point square) and need at some point to be scaled up to the desired point 
size. Barcodes are naturally sized in points, and should be scaled at 
approximately I<1>. Therefore, it would greatly overscale barcodes to multiply 
by image width and height I<within> C<formimage>, and require scaling of 
1/width and 1/height in the call. So, we leave scaling alone within 
C<formimage> and have the user manually scale I<images> by the image width and 
height (in pixels) in the call to C<formimage>.

=over

Places an image or other external object (a.k.a. XObject) on the page in the
specified location (giving the upper left corner of the object). Note that this
positioning is I<different> from C<image()> and C<formimage()>, which give the
I<lower left> corner!

Up to four optional arguments may be given, with their defaults as described
below.

C<$x> and C<$y> are the I<upper left> corner of the object. If they are 
omitted, the object will be placed with its I<lower left> corner at C<[0, 0]>.
B<Note> that if the object's bounding box has the fourth value (maximum
ascender) greater than 0, you may need to subtract that value from C<y> to get
the desired vertical position! A typical application will have a bounding box
of C<[0, -height, width, 0]>, and no correction is needed. If the bounding box
is C<[0, -max_descender, width, max_ascender]>, you may need to add the
correction.

For images, C<$scale_x> and C<$scale_y> represent the width and height of the
image on the page, in points. If C<$scale_x> is omitted, it will default to 72
pixels per inch. If C<$scale_y> is omitted, the image will be scaled
proportionally, based on the image dimensions.

For other external objects, including B<SVG images>, the scale is a 
multiplier, where 1 (the default) represents 100% (i.e., no change).

If coordinate transformations have been made (see Coordinate Transformations
above), the position and scale will be relative to the updated coordinates.

If no coordinate transformations are needed, this method can be called directly
from the L<PDF::Builder::Page> object instead.

If an SVG XObject array (output from C<image_svg()>) is passed in, only the
first [0th] element will be displayed. Any others will be ignored.

=head3 Text State Parameters

All of the following parameters that take a size are applied before
any scaling takes place, so you don't need to adjust values to
counteract scaling.

=head4 charspace, character_spacing, char_space

    $spacing = $content->charspace($spacing)

=over

Sets additional B<horizontal> spacing between B<characters> in a line. Vertical 
writing systems are not supported. This is in I<points> and is initially zero.
It may be positive to give an I<expanded> effect to words, or
it may be negative to give a I<condensed> effect to words.
If C<$spacing> is given, the current setting is replaced by that value and
C<$self> is B<returned> (to permit chaining).
If C<$spacing> is not given, the current setting is B<returned>.

One use for character spacing is to adjust I<tracking> in a line of text.
It is common to adjust inter-word spacing (e.g., TeX "glue" length) to justify 
a line (see C<wordspace>), but in cases where the result is words too close 
together (or too far apart), you may want to adjust tracking in order to force 
spaces back to a more "reasonable" standard size. For example, if you have a 
fairly "loose" line, with wide spaces between words, you could add a little 
character spacing between the letters of words, and shrink the spaces down to a 
more reasonable size. Don't overdo it, and make the words themselves difficult
to read! You also would want to take care to "drive" the resulting spaces 
towards a consistent width throughout a document (or at least, a paragraph).

You may also choose to use character spacing for special effects, such as a
high-level heading expanded with extra space. This is a decorative effect, and
should be used with restraint.

Note that interword spaces (x20) I<also> receive additional character space,
in addition to any additional word space (C<wordspace>) defined!

B<CAUTION:> be careful about using C<charspace> if you are using a connected
("script") font. This might include Arabic, Devanagari, Latin cursive 
handwriting, and so on. You don't want to leave gaps between characters, or 
cause overlaps. For such fonts and typefaces, you I<may> need to explicitly set 
the C<charspace> spacing to 0, if you have set it to non-zero elsewhere. 
PDF::Builder may not be able to determine that a given font is a connected
script font, and automatically suppress non-zero character spacing.

B<Alternate names:> C<character_spacing> and C<char_space>

I<character_spacing> is provided for compatibility with PDF::API2, while
I<char_space> is provided to be consistent with many other method name

Sets additional B<horizontal> spacing between B<words> in a line. Vertical 
writing systems are not supported. This is in I<points> and is initially zero 
(i.e., just the width of the space, without anything extra). It may be negative
to close up sentences a bit. 
If C<$spacing> is given, the current setting is replaced by that value and
C<$self> is B<returned> (to permit chaining).
If C<$spacing> is not given, the current setting is B<returned>.

See the note in C<charspace> in regards to I<tracking> adjustment, and its
effect on C<wordspace>. The two calls may often be used together for optimal
results (although resulting in a somewhat increased PDF file size).

Note that it is a limitation of the PDF specification (as of version 1.7, 
section 9.3.3) that only spacing with an ASCII space (x20) is adjusted. Neither
required blanks (xA0) nor any multiple-byte spaces (including thin and wide
spaces) are currently adjusted. B<However,> multiple I<spaces> between words
I<each> are expanded. E.g., if you have a double x20 space between words, it
will receive I<twice> the expansion of a single space! Furthermore, character
spacing (Tc) is also added to each space, in I<addition> to word spacing (Tw).

=head4 hscale

    $scale = $content->hscale($scale)

=over

Sets the percentage of horizontal text scaling (relative sizing, I<not> 
spacing). This is initally 100 (percent, i.e., no scaling). A scale of greater 
than 100 will stretch the text, while less than 100 will compress it.
If C<$scale> is given, the current setting is replaced by that value and
C<$self> is B<returned> (to permit chaining).
If C<$scale> is not given, the current setting is B<returned>.

Note that scaling affects all of the character widths, interletter spacing, and
interword spacing. It is inadvisable to stretch or compress text by a large 
amount, as it will quickly make the text unreadable. If your objective is to 
justify text, you will usually be better off using C<charspace> and C<wordspace>
to expand (or slightly condense) a line to fill a desired width. Also see 
the C<text_justify()> calls for this purpose.

=over

Sets or gets the font and font size. C<$font> is an object created by calling
L<PDF::Builder/"font"> to add the font to the document.

    # Example (12 point Helvetica)
    my $pdf = PDF::Builder->new();

    my $font = $pdf->font('Helvetica');
    $text->font($font, 24);
    $text->position(72, 720);
    $text->text('Hello, World!');

    $pdf->save('sample.pdf');

Or, get the current font object and size setting:

    my ($font, $size) = $text->font();

Results ($font and $size) are indeterminate if font() was not previously called
using them.

If called I<without> arguments (Get), returns the current position of the

=head4 distance

    $content->distance($dx,$dy)

=over

This moves to the start of the previously-written line, plus an offset by the 
given amounts, which are both required. C<[0,0]> would overwrite the previous 
line, while C<[0,36]> would place the new line 36pt I<above> the old line 
(higher y). The C<$dx> moves to the right, if positive.

C<distance> is analogous to graphic's C<move>, except that it is relative to
the beginning of the previous text write, not to the coordinate origin.
B<Note> that subsequent text writes will be relative to this new starting
(left) point and Y position! E.g., if you give a non-zero C<$dx>, subsequent
lines will be indented by that amount.

=head4 cr

    $content->cr($vertical_offset)

    $content->cr(0)

=over

If passed without an argument, moves (down) to the start of the I<next> line 
(distance set by C<leading>). This is similar to C<nl()>.

If passed I<with> an argument, the C<leading> distance is ignored and the next 
line starts that far I<up> the page (positive value) or I<down> the page 
(negative value) from the current line. "Y" increases upward, so a negative
value would normally be used to get to the next line down.

An argument of I<0> would
simply return to the start of the present line, overprinting it with new text.
That is, it acts as a simple carriage return, without a linefeed.

Note that any setting for C<leading> is ignored. If you wish to account for
the C<leading> setting, you may wish to use the C<crlf> method instead.

=head4 nl

    $content->nl($indent)

=over

Moves to the start of the next line (see C<leading>). If C<$indent> is not given,
or is 0, there is no indentation. Otherwise, indent by that amount (I<out>dent
if a negative value). The unit of measure is hundredths of a "unit of text
space", or roughly 88 per em.

Moves to the start of the next line, based on the L</"leading"> setting. It

Returns the number of points that will be used (horizontally) by the input

Options %opts:

=over

=item 'font' => $f3_TimesRoman

Change the font used, overriding $self->{' font'}. The font must have been
previously created (i.e., is not the name). Example: use Times-Roman.

=item 'fontsize' => 12

Change the font size, overriding $self->{' fontsize'}. Example: 12 pt font.

=item 'wordspace' => 0.8

Change the additional word spacing, overriding $self->wordspace(). 
Example: add 0.8 pt between words.

=item 'charspace' => -2.1

Change the additional character spacing, overriding $self->charspace(). 
Example: subtract 2.1 pt between letters, to condense the text.

=item 'hscale' => 125

Change the horizontal scaling factor, overriding $self->hscale(). 
Example: stretch text to 125% of its natural width.

=back

B<Returns> the B<width of the $string> (when set as a line of type), based 
on all currently set text-state
attributes. These can optionally be overridden with %opts. I<Note that these
values temporarily B<replace> the existing values, B<not> scaling them up or

=head3 Rendering Text

=head4 Single Lines

=head4 text

    $width = $content->text($text, %opts)

=over

Adds text to the page (left justified by default). 
The width used (in points) is B<returned>.

Options:

=over

=item 'align' => position

Align the text, assuming left-to-right writing direction (RTL/bidirectional is
not currently supported).

=over

=item 'l' or 'left' (case insensitive).

B<default.> Text I<begins> at the current text position.

=item 'c' or 'center' (case insensitive).

Text is I<centered> at the current text position.

=item 'r' or 'right' (case insensitive). 

Text I<ends> (is right justified to) at the current text position.

=back

In all cases, the ending text position is at the (right) end of the text.
If mixing various alignments, you should explicitly place the current text
position so as to not overwrite earlier text.

=item 'indent' => $distance

Indents the text by the number of points (A value less than 0 gives an
I<outdent>).
The indentation amount moves the text left (negative indentation) or right 
(positive indentation), regardless of alignment. This allows desired alignment
effects (for centered and right) that aren't exactly aligned on the current 
position. For example, consider a column of decimal numbers centered on a
desired I<x> position, but aligned on their decimal points. The C<indent>
would be on a per-line basis, adjusted by the length of the number and the
decimal position.

=item 'underline' => 'none'

=item 'underline' => 'auto'

=item 'underline' => $distance

=item 'underline' => [$distance, $thickness, ...]

Underlines the text. C<$distance> is the number of units beneath the
baseline, and C<$thickness> is the width of the line.
Multiple underlines can be made by passing several distances and
thicknesses. 
A value of 'none' means no underlining (is the default).

Example:
 
    # 3 underlines:
    #   distance 4, thickness 1, color red
    #   distance 7, thickness 1.5, color yellow
    #   distance 11, thickness 2, color (strokecolor default)
    'underline' => [4,[1,'red'],7,[1.5,'yellow'],11,2],

=item 'strikethru' => 'none'

=item 'strikethru' => 'auto'

=item 'strikethru' => $distance

=item 'strikethru' => [$distance, $thickness, ...]

Strikes through the text (like HTML I<s> tag). A value of 'auto' places the
line about 30% of the font size above the baseline, or a specified C<$distance>
(above the baseline) and C<$thickness> (in points).
Multiple strikethroughs can be made by passing several distances and
thicknesses.
A value of 'none' means no strikethrough. It is the default.

Example:
 
    # 2 strikethroughs:
    #   distance 4, thickness 1, color red
    #   distance 7, thickness 1.5, color yellow
    'strikethru' => [4,[1,'red'],7,[1.5,'yellow']],

=item 'strokecolor' => color_spec

Defines the underline or strikethru line color, if different from the text
color.

=head4 textHS

=over

Takes an array of hashes produced by HarfBuzz::Shaper and outputs them to the
PDF output file. HarfBuzz outputs glyph CIDs and positioning information. 
It may rearrange and swap characters (glyphs), and the result may bear no
resemblance to the original Unicode point list. You should see 
examples/HarfBuzz.pl, which shows a number of examples with Latin and non-Latin 
text, as well as vertical writing. 
https://www.catskilltech.com/Examples has a sample available in case you want 
to see some examples of what HarfBuzz can do, and don't yet have 
HarfBuzz::Shaper installed.

=over

=item $HSarray

This is the reference to array of hashes produced by HarfBuzz::Shaper, normally 
unchanged after being created (but I<can> be modified). See 
L<PDF::Builder::Docs/Using Shaper> for some things that can be done.

=item $settings

This a reference to a hash of various pieces of information that C<textHS()> 
needs in order to function. They include:

=over

=item 'script' => 'script_name'

This is the standard 4 letter code (e.g., 'Latn') for the script (alphabet and
writing system) you're using. Currently, only Latn (Western writing systems)
do kerning, and 'Latn' is the default. HarfBuzz::Shaper will usually be able to 
figure out from the Unicode points used what the script is, and you might be 
able to use the C<set_script()> call to override its guess. However, 
PDF::Builder and HarfBuzz::Shaper do not talk to each other about the script 
being used.

=item 'features' => array_of_features

This item is B<required>, but may be empty, e.g., 
C<$settings-E<gt>{'features'} = ();>.
It can include switches using the standard HarfBuzz naming, and a + or -
switch, such as '-liga' to turn B<off> ligatures. '-liga' and '-kern', to turn
off ligatures and kerning, are the only features supported currently. B<Note>
that this is separate from any switches for features that you send to 
HarfBuzz::Shaper (with C<$hb-E<gt>add_features()>, etc.) when you run it 
(before C<textHS()>).

=item 'language' => 'language_code'

This item is optional and currently does not appear to have any substantial
effect with HarfBuzz::Shaper. It is the standard code for the
language to be used, such as 'en' or 'en_US'. You might need to define this for
HarfBuzz::Shaper, in case that system can't surmise the language rules to be 
used.

=item 'dir' => 'flag'

Tell C<textHS()> whether this text is to be written in a Left-To-Right manner 
(B<L>, the B<default>), Right-To-Left (B<R>), Top-To-Bottom (B<T>), or 
Bottom-To-Top (B<B>). From the script used (Unicode points), HarfBuzz::Shaper 
can usually figure out what direction to write text in. Also, HarfBuzz::Shaper 
does not share its information with PDF::Builder -- you need to separately 
specify the direction, unless you want to accept the default LTR direction. You 
I<can> use HarfBuzz::Shaper's C<get_direction()> call (in addition to 
C<get_language()> and C<get_script()>) to see what HarfBuzz thinks is the 
correct text direction. C<set_direction()> may be used to override Shaper's
guess as to the direction.

By the way, if the direction is RTL, HarfBuzz will reverse the text and return 
an array with the last character first (to be written LTR). Likewise, for BTT, 
HarfBuzz will reverse the text and return a string to be written from the top 
down. Languages which are normally written horizontally are usually set 
vertically with direction TTB. If setting text vertically, ligatures and 
kerning, as well as character connectivity for cursive scripts, are 
automatically turned off, so don't let the direction default to LTR or RTL in 
the Shaper call, and then try to fix it up in C<textHS()>.

=item align => 'flag'

Given the current output location, align the
text at the B<B>eginning of the line (left for LTR, right for RTL), B<C>entered
at the location, or at the B<E>nd of the line (right for LTR, left for RTL).
The default is B<B>. B<C>entered is analogous to using C<text_center()>, and
B<E>nd is analogous to using C<text_right()>. Similar alignments are done for
TTB and BTT.

=item 'dump' => flag

Set to 1, it prints out positioning and glyph CID information (to STDOUT) for
each glyph in the chunk. The default is 0 (no information dump).

=item 'minKern' => amount (default 1)

If the amount of kerning (font character width B<differs from> glyph I<ax> 
value) is I<larger> than this many character grid units, use the unaltered ax 
for the width (C<textHS()> will output a kern amount in the TJ operation). 
Otherwise, ignore kerning and use ax of the actual character width. The intent 
is to avoid bloating the PDF code with unnecessary tiny kerning adjustments in 
the TJ operation.

=back

=item %opts

This a hash of options.

=over

=item 'underline' => underlining_instructions

See C<text()> for available instructions.

=item 'strikethru' => strikethrough_instructions

See C<text()> for available instructions.

=item 'strokecolor' => line_color

Color specification (e.g., 'green', '#FF3377') for underline or strikethrough,
if not given in an array with their instructions.

=back

=back

Text is sent I<separately> to HarfBuzz::Shaper in 'chunks' ('segments') of a 
single script (alphabet), a
single direction (LTR, RTL, TTB, or BTT), a single font file, 
and a single font size. A 
chunk may consist of a large amount of text, but at present, C<textHS()> can 
only output a single line. For long lines that need to be split into 
column-width lines, the best way may be to take the array of hashes returned by
HarfBuzz::Shaper and split it into smaller chunks at spaces and other 
whitespace. You may have to query the font to see what the glyph CIDs are for 
space and anything else used.

It is expected that when C<textHS()> is called, that the font and font size
have already been set in PDF::Builder code, as this information is needed to
interpret what HarfBuzz::Shaper is returning, and to write it to the PDF file.
Needless to say, the font should be opened from the same file as was given
to HarfBuzz::Shaper (C<ttfont()> only, with .ttf or .otf files), and the font
size must be the same. The appropriate location on the page must also already
have been specified.

=head2 Advanced Methods

=head3 save

    $content->save()

=over

Saves the current I<graphics> state on a PDF stack. See PDF definition 8.4.2 
through 8.4.4 for details. This includes the line width, the line cap style, 
line join style, miter limit, line dash pattern, stroke color, fill color,
current transformation matrix, current clipping port, flatness, and dictname.

This method applies to I<only> I<gfx/graphics> objects. If attempted with
I<text> objects, you will receive a one-time (per run) warning message, and
should update your code B<not> to do save() and restore() on a text object.
Only save() generates the message, as presumably each restore() has already had
a save() performed.

=head3 restore

    $content->restore()

=over

Restores the most recently saved graphics state (see C<save>),
removing it from the stack. You cannot I<restore> the graphics state (pop it off
the stack) unless you have done at least one I<save> (pushed it on the stack).
This method applies to both I<text> and I<gfx/graphics> objects.

    } else {

    }

   return $self;
}

=head3 add

    $content->add(@content)

=over

Add raw content (arbitrary string(s)) to the PDF stream. 
You will generally want to use the other methods in this class instead,
unless this is in order to implement some PDF operation that PDF::Builder
does not natively support. An array of multiple strings may be given; 
they will be concatenated with spaces between them.

Be careful when doing this, as you are dabbling in the black arts, 
directly setting PDF operations! 

One interesting use is to split up an overly long object stream that is giving 
your editor problems when exploring a PDF file. Add a newline B<add("\n")> 
every few hundred bytes of output or so, to do this. Note that you must use 
double quotes (quotation marks), rather than single quotes (apostrophes).

Use extreme care if inserting B<BT> and B<ET> markers into the PDF stream.
You may want to use C<textstart()> and C<textend()> calls instead, and even
then, there are many side effects either way. It is generally not useful 
to suspend text mode with ET/textend and BT/textstart, but it is possible, 
if you I<really> need to do it.

Another, useful, case is when your input PDF is from the B<Chrome browser> 
printing a page to PDF with
headers and/or footers. In some versions, this leaves the PDF page with a
strange scaling (such as the page height in points divided by 3300) and the 
Y-axis flipped so 0 is at the top. This causes problems when trying to add
additional text or graphics in a new text or graphics record, where text is 
flipped (mirrored) upsidedown and at the wrong end of the page. If this 
happens, you might be able to cure it by adding

    $scale = .23999999; # example, 792/3300, examine PDF or experiment!
     ...
    if ($scale != 1) {
        my @pageDim = $page->mediabox();     # e.g., 0 0 612 792
        my $size_page = $pageDim[3]/$scale;  # 3300 = 792/.23999999
        my $invScale = 1.0/$scale;           # 4.16666684
        $text->add("$invScale 0 0 -$invScale 0 $size_page cm");
    }

as the first output to the C<$text> stream. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
predict exactly what C<$scale> should be, as it may be 3300 units per page, or
a fixed amount. You may need to examine an uncompressed PDF file stream to 
see what is being used. It I<might> be possible to get the input (original) 
PDF into a string and look for a certain pattern of "cm" output

    .2399999 0 0 -.23999999 0 792 cm

or similar, which is not within a save/restore (q/Q). If the stream is 
already compressed, this might not be possible.

=head3 addNS

    $content->addNS(@content)

=over

Like C<add()>, but does B<not> make sure there is a space between each element
and before and after the new content. It is up to I<you> to ensure that any
necessary spaces in the PDF stream are placed there explicitly!

=head3 compressFlate

    $content->compressFlate()

=over

Marks content for compression on output.  This is done automatically
in nearly all cases, so you shouldn't need to call this yourself.

The C<new()> call can set the B<compress> parameter to 'flate' (default) to
compress all object streams, or 'none' to suppress compression and allow you
to examine the output in an editor.

=head3 textstart

    $content->textstart()

=over

Starts a text object (ignored if already in a text object). You will likely 
want to use the C<text()> method (text I<context>, not text output) instead.

Note that calling this method, besides outputting a B<BT> marker, will reset
most text settings to their default values. In addition, B<BT> itself will
reset some transformation matrices.
