The devtools directory is a collection of tools and utilities used to create
and package a PDF::Builder distribution. I've moved them to here so that they
can be preserved on GitHub and not be lost should I disappear from the scene,
and my (hopefully erased) laptop ends up at a thrift shop! I hope that they 
will help whoever takes over this repository (as well as anyone forking it) to 
hit the ground running.

These tools are not intended to be shipped with the product (e.g., the CPAN
package), but are just being kept with the rest of the code. PDFbuild.pl is
the only one that needs to be explicitly run, once you have "version" set up.
The output is a CPAN-ready PDF-Builder-3.xxx.tar.gz package file.

There is also an "html2php.pl" utility to take .html files produced locally by
tools/buildDoc.pl, and create a set of PHP files for clean web display. Note
however, that these use a library of my own (see catskilltech.com); you would
need to rewrite the page prologues and epilogues to use a different library.

Note that these use Windows commands and batch files, and assume we're using
Strawberry Perl; if you develop on Linux or other, you will need to update the 
code to use proper Linux commands and directory structures.

  copy -> cp -p
  xcopy [/s] -> [recursively] copy according to a filename template, possibly
                with find, for, and cp -p
  rename -> mv
  attrib -> chmod (+R make read-only, -R make read-write, else just list
                   permissions/attributes R, A, S, H, etc.)
  findstr -> grep
  erase -> rm
  mkdir -> mkdir

  7z.exe is the tar/gzip/zip file packager "7-Zip" available on the web, and 
installed into \Program Files\7-Zip. If you cannot obtain it, you will need to
replace various calls to produce tar files, compress with gzip, or (possibly)
produce .zip files.

  dos2unix.exe is a utility found on the web (IIRC, as part of a local Git
installation), and installed under \Program Files\Git. It reformats DOS style
text file line-ends (CRLF) to Unix style (NL).
